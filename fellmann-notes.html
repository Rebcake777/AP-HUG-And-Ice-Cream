<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning! &nbsp;I am so happy you are joining us for our Voyage of Discovery in the wonderful world of Human Geography! &nbsp;Human Geography is the study of man's interconnections with the physical Earth. &nbsp;Basically, we will be learning where places and people are and why they are there! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we will be answering questions such as: what basic concepts do geographers use to study the world? &nbsp;Where are people located throughout the world? What different cultural groups make up the world and why are these differences important? &nbsp;How do people earn a living in different parts of the world? &nbsp;Why are cities and other urban cities important and how are they different? Of course, we will look at many other concepts, too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geography is a spatial science. &nbsp;Geographers study space to locate where people live and why they choose to live in that place. &nbsp;We are all born geographers! &nbsp;We all have a sense of curiosity about the spaces and places around us! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I conducted a study of Old Order Amish children&rsquo;s concepts of their neighborhood and compared them with rural non-Amish children who lived in the same area. &nbsp;Because of the cultural differences between Amish and non-Amish kids, their sense of place as shown in sketch maps of their neighborhoods, was really interesting and not at all similar!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amish children only drew their immediate farm or house and barn yard. &nbsp;The non-Amish children drew maps of the entire rural community. What I discovered was that much can be learned about an individual's perception of place, neighborhood, home, from their sketch maps! Home and family are the Amish child's entire world (they are very sheltered from the n on-Amish world) while the non-Amish child &nbsp;has a much larger neighborhood thanks to exposure through T.V., radio, movies, newspapers, and other media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chapter introduces you to a few of the important concepts regarding space and place &ndash; the two core concepts of geography. &nbsp;You will find out why a farmer lives and farms in a certain location &nbsp;and why he probably won&rsquo;t want to live and farm in another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First you will learn about a sense of place and its opposite &ndash; placelessness. &nbsp;What makes your city special? &nbsp;You will learn about location and the difference between absolute and relative locations. &nbsp;&nbsp;Site and situation relate directly to location. &nbsp;Distance is another concept we explore this week. </span></p>
</div> 

<p><strong>Key Concepts: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The nature of geography and the role of human geography</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Seven fundamental geographic observations and the basic concepts that underlie them</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The regional concept and the characteristics of regions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Why geographers use maps and how maps show spatial information</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other means of visualizing and analyzing spatial data; mental maps, systems, and models</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do geographers describe where things are? Why is each point on Earth unique? &nbsp;How are different locations interrelated? How do people relate to their environment?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geographers study space to locate where people live and why they choose to live in that place; they are interested in how things are interrelated in different regions and give evidence of the existence of </span><strong>&ldquo;spatial systems&rdquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">; they focus on the interaction of people and social groups with their environment and with each other; they seek to understand how and why physical and cultural spatial patterns evolved through time and continue to change</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Geography</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not simply knowing where things are; it is the study of spatial variation, of how and why things differ from place to place on the surface of the earth; it is further the study of how observable spatial patterns evolved through time; Geography is about geographic space and its content; it is the mother of sciences;</span><strong> is the study of the earth&rsquo;s surface and its physical and cultural content</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Knowing where things are located geographically is only the first step toward understanding why things are where they are, and what events and processes determine or change their distribution</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Because geographers study both the physical environment and the human use of environment, they are sensitive to the variety of forces affecting a place and to the interactions among them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The name geography was coined by Greek scientist Eratosthenes over 2200 years ago from the words geo &ldquo;the earth&rdquo;, and graphein &ldquo;to write&rdquo;. That writing focused on the physical structure of the earth and the nature and activities of the people who inhabited it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- To Strabo the task of geography was to &ldquo;describe the several parts of the inhabited world&hellip;.to write the assessment of the countries of the world and to treat the differences between countries&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Greek and later Roman geographers measured the earth, devised the global grid of parallels and meridians (latitudes and longitudes) and drew on that grid maps of their known world; they focused on how humans lived, similarities and differences in cultures, how they used the land</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Strabo warned against the idea that humans were determined by the physical environment; he said that humans were part of a human environmental partnership</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- ancient Chinese were also involved (500 A.D); as Christian Europe entered Middle Ages and lost greek and roman geographical work (1400 A.D.), Muslim scholars retained knowledge and described and analyzed their known world in &ldquo;Roger&rsquo;s Book.&rdquo; (written by arab geographer Idrisi directed by Roger II(1099 - 1154), to collect all known geographical info and assemble it in an accurate representation of the world; divided into seven climates of greek geographers, which were each divided by perpendicular lines into 11 parts beginning with the west coast of Africa and ending with the east coast of Asia)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Modern geography surged in 17th century- outset was recognized as a broadly based integrative study</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- 19th century- national censuses, trade statistics, ethnographic studies gave foundation to human geography</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geography is characterized by</span><strong> three interests</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Areal variation of physical and human phenomena</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the surface of the earth- examine relationship between human societies and the natural environments they occupy</span></li>
<li><strong>Focus on the spatial systems that link physical phenomena and human activities </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in one area of the earth</span></li>
<li><strong>Regional analysis:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> geography studies human-environmental- ecological- relationships and spatial systems in specific locational settings- REgional geography</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Others identify classes of things, rather than segments of the earth&rsquo;s surface: </span><strong>Systematic Geographers-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focus their attentions on one or a few related aspects of the physical environment or of human population and society; in each case, the topic selected is examined in its interrelationships with other spatial systems; </span><strong>Physical geography </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">directs its attention to the natural environmental side of the human; the other systematic branch is Human geography</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Human Geography: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">deals with the world as it is and the world as it might be; emphasis on people- where they are, what they are like, how they interact what kinds of landscapes they use; it provides integration for all the social sciences- it gives them the necessary spatial and systems viewpoint; human geography helps us understand the world we occupy and appreciate the circumstances affecting people and countries; it clarifies contrasts in societies</span></p>
<p><strong>- 8 Subdivisions of human geography: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political Geography- political science; Population Geography- demography; Historical Geography- History; Urban Geography- urban studies, planning; Social Geography- Sociology, language, religious studies; Economic Geography- regional economics, economics; Behavior Geography- psychology, economics; Cultural GEography- Anthropology, sociology, history</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The topics of human geography are diverse, but that emphasizes the fact that all geographers are united by the questions they ask: what, where, how did it come to be, where in relation to other things, how is it changing, how is it functioning as a whole, how do people affect it, how does its location affect people? These questions are rooted in Geography&rsquo;s central concern with</span><strong> Space and Place</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Space</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implies areal extent and may be understood in both an absolute and relative sense;</span><strong> Absolute space-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> physically real with measurable extent and definable boundaries- therefore space is fundamental to areal relationships among physical or cultural features on the earth&rsquo;s surface and is basic to geographic interests like making maps, analyzing distributions, and conducting spatial analysis; </span><strong>Relative space-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> perceptual and variable- therefore space can be seen as socially produced, reflecting activities and interrelationships; since these two are constantly changing, relative space adjusts in response</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Place </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the companion of Space. Place is a synonym for location. Place refers to the attributes and values we associate with a location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The sense of place is reinforced by local and regional distinctiveness. It may be diminished and replaced by </span><strong>Placelessness.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geography is a spatial science, concerned with spatial behavior and spatial relationships, with spatial interactions, with spatial processes. The word spatial always carries the idea of the way items are distributed, the way movements occur, and the way processes operate over the whole or a part of the surface of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The need to understand these things frame the questions geographers ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Means by which Geographers express fundamental observations about the earth:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Places have location, direction, and distance with respect to other places- spatial concepts</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are ways of assessing the space around us and identifying our position in relation to other items and places of interest. They are also essential in understanding the processes of spatial interaction</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Location: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the location is the starting point of all geographic study as well as personal movements and spatial actions. We think and refer to location in 2 different senses: absolute and relative</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>- Absolute location </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the identification of place by some precise and accepted system of coordinates; sometimes called mathematical location. We have several such systems of pinpointing positions- parallels and meridians- the location of any point can be described by reference of latitude and longitude. This is unique to each place, and has value in measuring distance or finding directions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When geographers say that location matters, they are not talking about absolute but </span><strong>relative location- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the position of a place in relation to other places and activities. This expresses spatial interconnection and may carry social and economic implications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geography uses these to make distinction between Site and Situation of a place:</span></p>
<p><strong>- Site, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">an absolute location, refers to the physical and cultural characteristics and attributes of the place itself. It is more than mathematical location b/c it tells us something about the internal features of that place</span></p>
<p><strong>- Situation </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">refers to the external relations of a locale; it is an expression of relative location with particular reference to items of significance</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Direction: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a second universal spatial concept; it has more than one meaning and can be expressed in absolute and relative terms</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>- Absolute direction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is based on cardinal points of N, S, E, and W; they are derived from nature- the rising and setting of the sun for E and W, and the sky location of noontime sun and stars for N and S. </span></p>
<p><strong>- Relative or relational directions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">out West, back East, down South, Near East, Far East- though these reference cardinal compass points, they are culturally based</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Distance: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">joins location and direction as a commonly understood term that has dual meanings- absolute and relative</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>- Absolute distance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to the spatial separation between two points on the earth&rsquo;s surface measured by a standard unit such as miles or kilometers</span></p>
<p><strong>- Relative distance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transforms linear measurements into other units more meaningful for the space relationship; most people think of time, money, or psychological transformation rather than linear distance (eg. 20 min. walk instead of 2 miles; 10 dollar cab away instead of 20 miles, and dangerous late night walk back to car or first time trip)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Lines of equal travel time (isochrones: from greek isos- equal, and chronos- time); distance relationships, their measurements, and their meaning for human spatial interaction are fundamental to our understanding of human geography</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A place has size; it may be large or small. Scale is important.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When we say a place is large or small, we speak both of the nature of the place and of the generalizations that can be made</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Scale- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be a feature of every map and essential to recognizing the areal meaning of the map; implies the degree of generalization represented; geographic inquiry can occur at many different size scales</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A place has both physical structure and cultural content. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geographers are concerned with identifying and analyzing the details of attributes and recognizing the interrelationship between the physical and cultural components of area: the human- environmental interface</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Physical characteristics- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural aspects provide the setting within which human action occurs- they help shape, but do not dictate, how humans live; human activity has been so universal that no &ldquo;natural landscape&rdquo; exists any longer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Environmental circumstances-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly affect agricultural potential and reliability, indirectly them may influence such matters as employment patterns, trade flows, population distributions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cultural Landscape-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visible expression of human activity</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Although the focus of this book is on human characteristics, geographers are aware that physical content of an area is important in understanding activity patterns and interconnections between people and their environments</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The attributes of places develop and change over time. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- characteristics of places today are the result of constantly changing past conditions; to understand fully the nature and development of places, geographers must view places as the present result of the past operation of distinctive physical and cultural processes; &ldquo;How did it come to be what and where it is?&rdquo; This is an inquiry about process and about becoming; the forces and events shaping the physical and explaining the cultural environment of places today are an important focus of geography; to understand them is to appreciate more fully the changing human spatial order of the world</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The elements of places interrelate with other places.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- relative location and distance lead to a fundamental spatial reality- places interact with other places in structured and comprehensible ways; in describing this Spatial Interaction, geographers use Accessibility and Connectivity</span></p>
<p><strong>- Tobler&rsquo;s First Law of Geography-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a spatial sense everything is related but relationships are stronger when items are nearer; interaction between places diminishes in intensity and frequency as distance between them increases- Distance Decay</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Accessibility- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">How easy is it to surmount the barrier of time and space separation- friction of distance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connectivity-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broader concept implying tangible and intangible ways in which places are connected; when routes are fixed, networks determine the efficiency of movement and connectedness of points; technology has erased time and distance barriers and have reduced our dependence on physical movement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Spatial diffusion-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process of dispersion of an idea or an item from a center of origin to more distant points; diffusion rates are affected by distance and population, means of communication, and prestige of the originating node</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Expansion diffusion: </span><strong>Hierarchical diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; king to people, </span><strong>Contagious diffusion </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; rapid spread of idea or trait into area like influenza, </span><strong>Stimulus diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; spread of a big idea or innovative feature</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Globalization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">stemmed from the above, recognition that spatial interaction is a fundamental organizing principle of life; implies increasing interconnection of peoples and societies as the full range of processes become international</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The content of places is structured and explainable.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- How are objects distributed in area. Where is it located, how does the location relate to other things, how did it come to be- these questions carry the conviction that the contents of an area are arranged or structured- called</span><strong> spatial distribution; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be analyzed by three elements</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Density-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> measure of the number or quantity of anything within a defined unit of area; it is not simply a count of items but of items in relation to the space in which they are found</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- WHen the relationship is absolute, it is arithmetic density; When it is a measure of number of persons per unit area, it is physiological density</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dispersion/concentration/distribution</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is a statement of the amount of spread of a phenomenon over an area; it tells not how many but how far things are spread; if they are close spatially, they are clustered or agglomerated; if they are spread out, they are dispersed or scattered</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Pattern</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the geometric arrangement of objects in space- refers to distribution, emphasizes design</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The distribution of houses along a street is l</span><strong>inear;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> items concentrated around a single node is called </span><strong>centralized;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an unstructured irregular distribution is called random; most streets in america display a </span><strong>grid or rectilinear pattern; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><strong>hexagonal pattern</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a mainstay of central place theory</span></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Places may be generalized into regions of similarities and differences. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the distinctive characteristics of a place suggests 2 ideas: first- no two places can be exactly the same; because geography is a spatial science, the inevitable uniqueness of place would seem to impose impossible problems of generalization; second- physical and cultural content show patterns of spatial similarity; these similarities permit us to recognize regions-earth areas that display significant elements of internal uniformity and external difference</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- regions are devised- spatial summaries designed to bring order to the diversity of the world; at their root, they are based on recognition and mapping of spatial distributions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Regions: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Formal or uniform Region:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uniformity in one or a limited combination of physical or cultural features (eg. Bible Belt)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Functional or Nodal Region:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parts are interdependent, operates as a dynamic, organizational unit; it has unity not only in the sense of static content but in the manner of its operational connectivity; its has a core area in which features are most clear; they lessen toward the margin or periphery</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Perceptual Regions:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reflect feelings and images rather than data; the vernacular regions they recognize have reality in their minds and are reflected in regionally based names or slogans</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>- Maps </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">are tools to identify regions and to analyze their content. The spatial distributions, patterns, and relations of interest to geographers usually cannot be easily observed and interpreted in the landscape itself. Only the map can reduce spatial distributions and interactions to an observable scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Maps generalize the date they display;</span><strong> Scale- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the relationship between size or length of a feature- determines that generalization</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the smaller the scale, the larger the area the map covers and the more generalized the data</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the larger the scale, the smaller the area and the more accurate representation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the larger the earth area on a map, the bigger the distortion b/c a map has to depict a 3d Earth on a 2d paper</span></p>
<p><strong>- Projection:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the method chosen to represent the earth&rsquo;s curved surface as a flat map; to minimize the distortion of the 4 main map properties- area, shape, distance, or direction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The key reference points in the grid system are the N and S poles and equator and the prime meridian; latitude measures distance N and S of the equator, and parallels of latitude run east-west; Longitude is the angular distance E or W of the prime meridian and depicted by NS lines called meridians, which converge at the poles</span></p>
<p><strong>- Properties of globe grid: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All meridians are semicircles of equal length, each is one half the length of the equator.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All meridians converge at the poles and are true north south semicircles</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All circles of latitude (parallels) are parallel to the equator and to each &nbsp;other</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Parallels decrease in circumference as one nears the poles.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Meridians and parallels intersect at right angles</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The scale on the surface of the globe is the same in every direction</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Only the globe grid retains all of these; to project it onto a flat surface distorts some of these properties</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Scale is reported to the map user in 3 ways: </span><strong>Verbal scale</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1 in. to 1 mile, in words), </span><strong>representative fraction </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(how many linear units on the earth&rsquo;s surface represented by one unit on the ma), and </span><strong>graphic scale</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (line or bar marked off in map units but labeled in ground units)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geographers are more interested in the depiction of spatial data and analysis of the patterns those data present. They must first select the items of concern to the problem, then decide how to display them for study or demonstration. THey can choose among different types of maps and different systems of symbolization</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Major classes of maps</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Familiar to everyone: </span><strong>General-purpose, Reference, or Location maps: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">their purpose is to show without analysis or interpretation a variety of natural or human made features of an area</span></li>
<li><strong>Thematic Maps:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a map of any scale that presents a graphic theme</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Qualitative: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to show the distribution of a particular class of info- eg. location of oil fields, distribution of national parks, areas of agricultural specialization; interest is in where things are, not in numbers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Quantitative : </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">show the spatial characteristic of numerical data; types of these maps:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Graduated circle map-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> circles of different size to show the frequency of occurrence of a topic in different places; the larger the circle, the more frequent the incidence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dot map- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">single or specified number of occurrences of the item studied is recorded by a single dot; serves not only to record data but to suggest spatial pattern, distribution, and dispersion </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Isometric map- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">features lines (isolines) that connect points registering equal values of the item mapped (iso means equal); isotherms shown on daily weather maps connect points recording the same temperature during the day; identical elevations may be shown by contour lines</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Isopleth map- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the calculation refers not to a point but to an areal statistic- persons per square kilo or average percentage of cropland- the isoline connects average values for unit areas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Choropleth map-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presents average value per preexisting areal unit- dwelling unit rents or assessed value by city block; when this map is based on the absolute number of items rather than on areal averaging, a misleading statement about density may be conveyed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Statistical map: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">record the actual numbers or occurrences of the mapped item</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cartogram:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses such statistical data to transform territorial space so that the largest areal unit is the one showing the greatest statistical value</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The growth and advancement of these three interrelated geospatial technologies has revolutionized geography and increased the ability to collect, analyze, and visually represent geographic data</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Global positioning systems- GPS-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relies on 24 orbiting satellites, earth bound tracking stations that control them, and portable receivers that determine exact geographic locations based on signals from the satellites. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Remote Sensing-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new term, but process of detecting the nature of an object and content from a distance is more than 150 years old (ogitigraogs); early 20th century- fixed wing aircraft provided a platform for camera and photographer, by 1930s aerial photography from planned routes and positions permitted reliable data for large and small area mapping; advantages of satellites- speed, coverage, large regions, equipped to record and report back to earth digitized information from multiple parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, enable us to map the invisible, including atmospheric and weather conditions, provides images with applications in agriculture and forest inventory</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Satellite imagery is relayed by electronic signals to receiving stations, where computers convert them into photolike images</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong> Geographic Information Systems- GIS-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extends the use of digitized data and computer manipulation to investigate and display spatial information; a set of discrete informational overlays linked by reference to a basic locational grid of latitude and longitude; the system then permits the separate display of the spatial information contained in the database; allows the user to overlay maps of different themes, analyze the relations revealed, and compute spatial relationships; as a structured set of spatial information, the GIS has become a tool for automating geographical analysis and synthesis both an integrated software package for handling, processing, and analyzing geographical data and a computer database in which every item of information is tied to a precise geographic location</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raster approach- that tie involves dividing the study area into a set of rectangular cells and describing the content of each cell</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vector Approach- the precise location of each object-point, line, or area- in a distribution is described</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- A GIS incorporates three primary components-</span><strong> data storage capability, computer graphics programs, and statistical packages</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Mental Maps- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">images about an area or an environment developed by an individual on the basis of information or impressions received, interpreted, and stored; we use this map in organizing our daily activities</span></p>
<p><strong>- Spatial systems, Spatial distributions </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the arrangement of a phenomenon across the Earth's surface and a graphical display of such an arrangement is an important tool in geographical and environmental statistics.</span></p>
<p><strong>- Map legend- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maps give information by using symbols. Symbols can be figures, shapes, lines, and colors that show where places and things are on a map. A map's legend tells you what the symbols mean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the systems of geographic concern are those in which the functionally important variables are spatial- location, distance, direction, density, and other basic concepts; the systems they define are not the same as regions, although spatial systems may be the basis for regional identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- systems have components, and the analysis of the role of components help reveal the operation of the system as a whole; to conduct that analysis, individual system elements must be isolated for separate identification and manipulated to see their function within the structure of the system or subsystem; maps (can segregate at a level of generalization those system elements; they compress, simplify, and abstract reality; are a type of models) and </span><strong>models </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(simplified abstraction of reality, designed to clarify relationships between its elements; used to simplify complex situations, eliminate unimportant details, and isolate for special study and analysis the role of one or more elements) are the devices geographers use to achieve that isolation and separate study</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-2">Chapter 2: Roots And Meaning Of Culture</h2> 

<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In later weeks, we will explore religion, language, and other aspects of human cultures more in-depth. &nbsp;This week, please focus on this short chapter about humans and the spread of their culture by exploring possibilism and environmental determinism- two differing ways of looking at how we humans interact with our environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 2 &ldquo;Roots and Meaning of Culture&rdquo; in Fellmann textbook. Learn the components of culture and the nature of human-environment interactions. We will discuss culture hearths and origins and what the structure of culture is and the forms of cultural change.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Geography</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the study of the physical and cultural components of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Physical geography-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pertains to the natural forces and landscapes of the world</span></p>
<p><strong>- Cultural geography/human geography</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- studies the human characteristics of a location and how these in turn relate and are affected by the natural world; study of the many cultural aspects found throughout the world and how they relate to the spaces and places where they originate and then travel as people continually move across various areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Traditional Cultural Geography- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">rooted in the belief that societies and cultures grow out of a landscape and also reshape the landscape. &nbsp;Those following this school of thought focus mainly on the physical cultural world, such as buildings, parks, and architecture, in non-modern and rural communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> New Cultural Geography-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came about in the 1980&rsquo;s and focuses on contemporary and urban cultures, examining non-physical elements such as gender, language, and identity.</span></p>
<p><strong>-"More-than-Representational" Geography</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- focuses on understanding a cultural landscape by physically witnessing the practices, focusing on how the human cultures are actually performed.</span></p>
<p><strong>- Globalization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">cultural integration that occurs as culture in the form of physical and nonphysical ideas and practices is exchanged throughout the world. &nbsp;This can occur in four forms: Trade and transaction, Capital and investment movements, Migration of people, The spread of knowledge and ideas. This is interesting because as culture created in one space and environment moves to new places, it adapts and integrates alongside the area's native culture.</span></p>
<p><strong>- 4 Traditions of Human Geography:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spatial Tradition (also called Locational Tradition), Area Studies Tradition (also called Regional Tradition), Man-Land Tradition (also called Human-Environmental, Human-Land, or Culture-Environment Tradition), and Earth Science Tradition</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Culture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the specialized behavior patterns, understandings, adaptations, and social systems that summarize a group of people&rsquo;s learned way of life; an ever-present part of the regional differences that are the essence of human geography; the visible and invisible/tangible and intangible evidences of culture are all parts of the spatial diversity geographers study; cultural differences over time and area result in contrasts between Stone Age humans and urban Americans, and rural Zimbabwe and the US or subtle differences between Paris, Moscow, and New York; separate human groups developed techniques </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to solve regionally varied problems, creating areally distinctive customs and ways of life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- culture is learned, not biological (instincts or genes)- transmitted within a society to generations by imitation, instruction, and example; as members of a social group, individuals acquire integrated sets of behavioral patterns, environmental and social perceptions, and knowledge of existing technologies; age, sex, status, and occupation dictate the aspects of the cultural whole in which one becomes indoctrinated</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Social structure</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- framework of roles and interrelationships of individuals and established groups</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Culture is a complexly interlocked web of behaviors and attitudes- its full and diverse content cannot be appreciated and may be wholly misunderstood if we concentrate on limited, obvious traits; they are fundamental cultural variables that give structure and spatial order to societies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Culture traits-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> units of learned behavior ranging from objects, techniques, beliefs, and attitudes- these are the building blocks of the complex behavioral patterns of distinctive groups of people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Culture complex-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> individual cultural traits that are functionally interrelated </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Cultural system-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broader generalization than a cultural complex and refers to the collection of interacting cultural traits and cultural complexes that are shared by a group within a particular territory</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Cultural traits, complexes, and systems have areal extent- geographers are interested in their spatial distribution but more with&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Culture region</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- portion of the earth&rsquo;s surface occupied by populations sharing recognizable and distinctive cultural characteristics</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Culture realm</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- set of culture regions showing related culture complexes and landscapes- culture regions at the broadest scale of recognition- may mislead more than they inform- validity is questioned in light of globalization of all aspects of society and economy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Globalization</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a homogenization of cultures as economics are integrated and uniform consumer demands satisfied- cultural flows, exchanges, and increasing mobility of people, goods, and information has reduced the compartmentalized ethnicities, languages, and religions- worldwide intermixture of peoples and customs; however, rather than leveling and removing regional contrasts, globalization is still countered by forces of regionalism, place identity, and ethnicity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Cultural ecology</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the study of the relationship between a culture group and the natural environment it occupies- interrelations of people to the environment of a given area, their perceptions and utilization of it, and their impact on it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Environmental determinism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the physical environment exclusively shapes humans., their actions, and their thoughts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Possibilism-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> viewpoints promoted by late 19-20th century French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache that people, not environments, are the dynamic forces of cultural development; the needs, traditions, and levels of technology of a culture affect how that culture assesses the possibilities of an area and shape what choices the culture makes regarding them; societies use natural resources in accordance with their circumstances; changes in a group&rsquo;s technical abilities or objectives bring about changes in its perceptions of the usefulness of the land- basically, the impact of the environment is inversely related to the level of development of a culture while perception of environmental opportunities increase directly with growth in economic and cultural development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The more technologically advanced and complex the culture, the more apparent is its impact on the natural landscape; urban-industrial societies- cultural landscape has come to outweigh the natural physical environment in its impact on daily lives- interposes itself between nature and humans</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Cultural landscape</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the earth&rsquo;s surface as modified by human action- tangible physical record of a given culture</span></p>
<p><strong>- Paleolithic</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Old Stone Age- the period at the end of glaciation during which small and scattered groups like the ivory hunters began to develop regional variations in their ways of life and livelihood</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Animal, plant, and human populations had been spatially confined by both the ice margin and the harsh climates of middle-latitude regions but began to spread, colonizing newly opened territories; Human migration increased population; improved tool technology greatly extended the range of possibilities in the use of locally available materials; the result was a more efficient and extensive exploitation of the physical environment than earlier had been possible; regional contrasts in plant and animal life and in environmental conditions also accelerated the differentiation of culture between isolated groups who had shared common characteristics</span></p>
<p><strong>- Hunter-gatherers-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pre-agricultural people dependent on the year-round availability of plant and animal foodstuffs they could secure with the rudimentary stone tools and weapons at their disposal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- By the end of the Ice Age, language, religion, long-distance trade, permanent settlements, and social stratification within groups appear to have been well developed in many European culture areas; what was learned and created was transmitted within the cultural group- the increasing variety of adaptive strategies and technologies and the diversity of noneconomic creations meant an inevitable cultural variation of humankind</span></p>
<p><strong>- Mesolithic</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Middle Stone Age- 11,000 to 5000 BC- transition from the collection of food to its production</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Beginning of periods of cultural evolution leading from hunting and gathering economies through agriculture and animal husbandry to urbanization and industrialization</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The stages of the Stone Age occurring during different time spans in different world areas mark distinctive changes in tools, tasks, and social complexities of cultures </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- As population rose and climatic fluctuation affected established plant and food sources, people began </span><strong>domestication</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of plants and animals; while adapting wild plants to agricultural purposes, the human cultivators adapted too- sedentary residence to protect planted areas, labor specializations, more formalized and expansive religious structures with fertility and harvest rites; the regional contrasts between hunter-gather and sedentary agricultural societies increased</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Cultural divergence</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Carrying capacity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- number of persons supportable within a given area by the technologies at their disposal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Neolithic- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stone Age- stage of cultural development- creation of advanced set of tools and technologies to deal with conditions and needs encountered by an expanding, sedentary population whose economy was based on the agricultural management of the environment- approx. 8000 to 3500 BC- brought revolutionary ad complex changes to human life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- On the foundation of specialized technical advancements, a complex exploitative culture appeared and a formal economy emerged- stratified society based on labor and role specialization replaced rough equality of adults in hunting and gathering economies; special local advantages in resources or products promoted development of long-distance trading connections</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- By the end of the Neolithic period: spatially restricted groups undertook the purposeful restructuring of their environment, new and more formalized rules of conduct and control emerged (punishment, law, private property), enforcement of rules of societies were increasingly stratified by social privileges and economic status, religions became more formalized, and occupations became specialized</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the social and technical revolutions of the Neolithic period were spatially confined; new technologies, ways of life, and social structures diffused from those points of origin and were selectively adopted by people not a party of their creation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Culture hearth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- centers of innovation and invention from which key culture traits and elements moved to exert influence on surrounding regions- cradle of any culture group whose developed systems of livelihood and life created a distinctive cultural landscape; complex social, intellectual, and technological bases that served as cultural diffusion centers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Civilizations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- indicators are writing, metallurgy, long-distance trade connections, astronomy and math, social stratification, and labor specialization- mostly urban centered</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Each hearth showed a rigorous organization of agriculture resulting in local productivity sufficient to enable a significant number of people to engage in nonfarm activities; creation of stratified societies; development of astronomy, math, and calendar; exporting of technologies, skills, and learned behaviors</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Multilinear evolution-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed by Julian Steward (1902-1972); to explain common characteristics of widely separated cultures developed under similar ecological circumstances- each major environmental zone-arid, high altitude, midlatitude steppe, tropical forest- tends to induce common adaptive traits in the cultures of those who exploit it; those traits were founded on the development of agriculture and the emergence of similar cultural and administrative structures in several culture hearths; but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">identical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- since comparable sequences of developmental events cannot always or even often be explained on the basis of borrowing or exporting of ideas and techniques (because of time and space differences), they must be regarded as evidence of parallel creations based on similar ecologies; from similar origins but through separate adaptations and innovations, distinctive cultures emerged</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Diffusionism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- belief that cultural similarities occur primarily by spatial spread (diffusion) from one or a few common origin sites; cultural advancement and civilizations are passed on along trade routes and through group contact rather than being the result of separate and independent creation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the common characteristics deriving from multilinear evolution and the spread of specific culture traits and complexes contains the roots of </span><strong>cultural convergence</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- sharing of technologies, organizational structures, cultural traits, and artifacts- proof of pervasive globalization of culture</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Leslie White (1900-1975) suggested that for analytical purposes, a culture could be viewed as a three-part structure composed of subsystems- these, identified by their separate components, comprise the system of culture as a whole</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideological subsystem</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- ideas, beliefs, and knowledge of a culture and the ways in which those things are expressed in speech or other forms of communication</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mentifacts</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- abstract belief systems passed from generation to generation- tell us how to believe, what to value, and how to act</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Beliefs form the basis of the socialization process</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Technological subsystem</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- composed of material objects, techniques of their use, and means by which people are able to live (tools and other instruments to keep us alive)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Artifacts-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> material objects to fill our basic needs</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sociological subsystem- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">sum of those expected and accepted patterns of interpersonal relations that find their outlet in economic, political, military, religious, kinship, and other associations</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sociofacts-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> define the social organization of a culture; regulate how individuals function in a group</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Cultural integration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">interlocking nature of all aspects of a culture</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The recurring theme is change- no culture is a permanently fixed set of material objects, systems of organization, or ideologies- they can only be long-enduring within a stable isolated society at equilibrium with its resource base</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Cultures are always in a state of flux- changes are major and pervasive, but some are not as extensive and cumulative- these changes occur because the cultural traits of any group are not independent- they are clustered in a coherent and integrated pattern; change on a small scale will have wide repercussions as associated traits arrive at accommodation with the adopted adjustment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Changes both major and minor are induced by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Innovation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- change to a culture that result from ideas created within the social group itself and adopted by the culture- may be invented improvement in material technology or development of nonmaterial social structure and interaction</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Widespread adoption of innovations can bring about large changes when viewed over a period of time- eventually a new cultural form will be identified that may have an important impact on the thinking processes of the adopters and those who come into contact with the adopters</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Pre-modern and traditional societies are not innovative- in societies at equilibrium with their environment and no unmet needs, change has no adaptive value and no reason to occur; all societies have an innate resistance to change since innovation creates tensions between the new reality and other established socioeconomic conditions; these tensions can be solved by adaptive changes elsewhere in the system</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Cultural lag- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">gap between a newly adopted technology and other, slower-paced social traits</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- All innovation has a radiating impact on the web of culture; the more basic the innovation, the more pervasive its consequences; the rate of invention has increased and the period between idea conception and product availability has decreased- the more ideas available and the more minds to exploit and combine them, the greater the rate of innovation- larger urban centers of advanced technologies tend to be centers of innovation because of their size and number of ideas interchanged; ideas not only stimulate new thoughts and viewpoints but also create circumstances in which the society must develop new solutions to maintain its forward momentum</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- process by which an idea or innovation is transmitted from one individual or group to another across space- two processes:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Relocation diffusion: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">people move to a new area and take their cultures with them- innovation or idea is physically carried and transported to new areas by carriers who permanently leave their home locale- migrating individuals or populations</span></p>
<p><strong>- Expansion diffusion:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spread of an item or idea from one place to another, with the thing diffused frequently intensified in the origin area; information about an innovation may spread through a society perhaps aided by local or mass media advertising, or new adopters of an ideology or way of life may be inspired or recruited by immigrant or native converts- a phenomenon spreads from one place to neighboring locations, but in the process remains and is often intensified in the place of origin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;</span><strong>Contagious diffusion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">when expansion diffusion affects uniformly all individuals and areas outward from the source region- importance of direct contact between those who developed or have adopted the innovation and those who newly encounter it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- If an idea has merit and people become adopters, the number of contacts of adopters with potential adopters will compound, so innovation will spread slowly at first and then more and more rapidly until saturation occurs or a barrier is reached; the incidence of adoption under contagious diffusion is represented by the S-curve</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Time-distance decay</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- can affect the rate of diffusion of a trait or idea - spread or acceptance of an idea is usually delayed as distance from the source of the innovation increases</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In some instances geographic distance is less important in the transfer of ideas than communication between major centers or important people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- </span><strong>Hierarchical diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- process of transferring ideas first between larger places or prominent people and later to smaller or less important points or people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Space-time compression</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- while the diffusion of ideas can be slowed by time-distance decay, their speed of spread can be increased to the point of becoming instantaneous by this concept, made possible by modern communication- modern communication technology has encouraged and facilitated globalization of culture</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- </span><strong>Stimulus diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a fundamental idea, though not the specific trait itself, stimulates imitative behavior within a receptive population </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In both expansion and relocation diffusion, innovations in technological or ideological subsystems are readily diffused to cultures that have basic similarities and compatibilities; diffusion cannot be viewed solely as the outcome of knowledge dispersed the acceptance of new traits, articles, or ways of doing or thinking by a potential receiving population depends not just on information flow to that population but also to entire cultural and economic structure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Culture is a complex organized system and culture change involves alteration of the system&rsquo;s established structure in ways that may be rejected even after knowledge is received</span></p>
<p><strong>- Independent/parallel invention</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- cultural similarities do not necessarily prove that diffusion has occurred</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Acculturation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a culture group may undergo major modifications in its own identifying traits by adopting some or all of the characteristics of another dominant culture group- where immigrant populations take on the values, attitudes, customs, and speech of the receiving society, which itself undergoes change from absorption of the arriving group</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Contact and subsequent cultural alteration may occur in a conquered or colonized region where the subordinate or subject population is forced to adopt the culture, introduced through relocation diffusion, or done voluntarily as a result of being overwhelmed by the superiority in numbers or the technical level of the conqueror</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Primitive indigenous groups brought into contact with conquering or absorbing societies may cease to exist as separate cultural entities; however, close contact between two different groups may involve adjustments of the original cultural patterns of both instead of the disappearance of either</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- </span><strong>Transculturation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- where the two-way flow reflects a more equal exchange of cultural outlooks and ways of life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- All cultures are amalgams of innumerable innovations spread spatially from their points of origin and integrated into the structure of the receiving societies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Since the pace of innovation is affected strongly by mixing of ideas among alert, responsive people and is increased by exposure to a variety of cultures, the most active and innovative historical hearths of culture were those at crossroads locations and those deeply involved in distant trade and colonization</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Recent changes in technology permit us to travel farther than ever before, with greater safety and speed, and to communicate without physical contact more easily and completely than was previously possible; this intensification of contact has resulted in the acceleration of innovation and the rapid spread of goods and ideas</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Diffusion barriers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- any obstacles and conditions that hinder either the flow of information or the movement of people and thus retard or prevent the acceptance of an innovation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Absorbing barrier- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">halts spread of an innovation- friction of distance/time-distance decay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- I</span><strong>nterrupting barriers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- interregional contact can also be hindered by physical environment and lack of receptivity- delaying or deflecting the path of diffusion- </span><strong>cultural barriers </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(political restrictions, religion)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Permeable barriers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- permit passage and acceptance of at least some innovations encountering them; the more similar two cultural areas are, the greater the likelihood of the adoption of an innovation- diffusion is a selective process- the decision to adopt is governed by the receiving group&rsquo;s culture</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Syncretism-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fusion of old and new, major feature of culture change; the alteration of meaning or form of diffused ideas and artifacts that makes them acceptable to a borrowing group- conformity (food)</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-3">Chapter 3: Spatial Interaction And Spatial Behavior</h2>

<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 3 (NOT Chapter 2!) &ldquo;Spatial Interaction and Spatial Behavior&rdquo; in Fellmann textbook. Learn about the three bases for spatial interaction, the nature of human spatial behavior, and the type of migration patterns. How do people decide to move and why? What influences these decisions? </span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes people migrate (California Gold Rush)- they are acting in space and across space on the basis of acquired knowledge and anticipation of opportunity- prepared to pay the price in time, money, and hardship costs of overcoming distance</span></p>
<p><strong>Spatial interaction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the movement of peoples, ideas, and commodities within and between areas- designed to achieve effective integration between different points of human activity; it represents the attempt to smooth out the spatially differing availability of required resources, commodities, information, or opportunities</span></p>
<p><strong>Commodity flows: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">responses to the differences of distribution of the world&rsquo;s resources and products; links between points of supply and locales of demand</span></p>
<p><strong>Edward Ullman-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speculated on the essential conditions affecting interactions of commodity flows and proposed a model- spatial interaction is controlled by complementarity, transferability, and intervening opportunity</span></p>
<p><strong>Complementarity-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for two places to interact, one place must have a supply for which there is an effective demand in the other</span></p>
<p><strong>Transferability-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acceptable costs of exchange; expression of the mobility of a commodity and a function of three interrelated conditions: characteristics and value of the product, distance measured in time and money penalties, and the ability of the commodity to bear the costs of movement</span></p>
<p><strong>Intervening Opportunity-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more attractive alternative sources of supply or demand closer at hand or cheaper</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We focus on general principles that govern frequency and intensity of interaction both to validate the three preconditions of spatial exchange and to establish the probability that any given potential interaction will occur</span></p>
<p><strong>Friction of distance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- distance has a retarding effect on human interaction</span></p>
<p><strong>Distance decay-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interchange decreases as distance increases; decline of an activity or function with increasing distance from its point of origin</span></p>
<p><strong>Inverse square relationship</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- interaction between places is inversely related to the square of the distance separating them</span></p>
<p><strong>Gravity model-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taken from Henry Carey, who observed that Newton&rsquo;s law of universal gravitation was applicable to the aggregate actions of humans; big things have a stronger attraction force (gravitational pull) than small objects and things close to each other have &nbsp;stronger mutual attraction than objects at greater distance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gravity model assures us that although spatial interaction always tends to decrease with increasing distance, at a certain point it tends to expand with increases</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carey had two interests: interaction between urban centers (solved by converting physical mass in the gravity model to population size while retaining the distance component of Newtonian calculation) and the fact that large cities have greater drawing power for individuals than do small ones (addressed by </span><strong>law of retail gravitation/Reilly&rsquo;s law:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Reilly determined the relative amount of retail trade that two cities would attract from an intermediate place in the vicinity of the breaking point, using the population and distance inputs of the gravity model; Reilly&rsquo;s law stated that two cities will attract trade from intermediate locales in direct proportion to the populations of the two cities and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance of these two cities to the intermediate place; it provides a quick determination of the trade boundary/breaking point of two places; this will define the </span><strong>&ldquo;trade area&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THe gravity model can be used to account for a wide variety of flow patterns; each pattern suggests that size as well as distance influence spatial interaction and help us understand friction distance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spatial interaction models of distance decay and gravitational pull deal with only two places at a time. In reality, it is much more complex. The more specialized the goods produced (the greater their collective complementarity), the more likely multiple interactions will occur</span></p>
<p><strong>Potential model</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- based on Newtonian physics; provides estimate of interaction opportunities available to a center in such a multicentered network; tells us the relative position of each point in relation to other places within a region; it sums up the size and distance relationships between all points of potential interaction; applicable whenever the measurement of the intensity of spatial interaction is of concern (marketing, broadcasting, etc..)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distance decay, and gravity and potential models help understand bases for interaction in an idealized area without natural or cultural barriers to movement or restrictions to routes followed, in which only rational interaction decisions are made</span></p>
<p><strong>Movement bias-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aggregate regularity of flow which is caused by the effect spatial interactions have on conditions under which future interactions will occur</span></p>
<p><strong>Distance bias- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">favors short movement over long ones</span></p>
<p><strong>Direction bias-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all possible directions of movement are restricted to only a few actual flows; reflects not just orientation but also intensity of flow</span></p>
<p><strong>Network bias-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the presence or absence of connecting channels strongly affects the likelihood that spatial interaction will occur</span></p>
<p><strong>Network-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set of routes and set of places that connect</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are not commodities and individually do not respond predictably to dictates of spatial interaction constraints; but to survive, people must be mobile and collectively react to distance, time, and cost considerations of movement in space and implications of complementarity, transferability, and intervening opportunity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of geographic inquiry involves how individuals make spatial behavioral decisions and how those decisions may be summarized by models and generalizations to explain collective actions</span></p>
<p><strong>Mobility-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;general term applied to all types of human territorial movement</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two aspects of mobility behavior/form of spatial interaction: </span><strong>circulation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (daily or temporary use of space) and </span><strong>migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (longer-term commitment to permanently leave home territory and find residence in new location)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both aspects: operate over time, impart rhythm to individual and group activity patterns, relate to how individuals perceive space and act within it and respond to information affecting their space-behavioral decision</span></p>
<p><strong>Territoriality- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotional attachment to and the defense of home ground</span></p>
<p><strong>Personal space- z</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of privacy and separation from others our culture or our physical circumstances require or permit</span></p>
<p><strong>Activity space</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an area within we move freely on our rounds of regular activity, sharing space with others also about their daily affairs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three interrelated variables that are order people&rsquo;s activity space: </span><strong>state in life</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (membership to specific age groups), </span><strong>mobility</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ability to travel), and </span><strong>demands or opportunities</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (individual assessment of the existence of possible activities)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are activities spatially restricted, but</span><strong> awareness space</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (knowledge of opportunity beyond normal activity space) is important</span></p>
<p><strong>Space-time prism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">representation of our daily space-time constraints/time geography, a volume of space and length of time within which our activities must be confined; size and shape are determined by mobility, boundaries define what we can or cannot accomplish spatially or temporally</span></p>
<p><strong>Space-time path- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">choices of things to do and places do to them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobility is a key to activity mix, time-budget, and activity space configurations</span></p>
<p><strong>Critical distance-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> distance beyond which cost, effort, and means strongly influence our willingness to travel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frictionless zone distance up to critical distance, time or distance considerations do not affect anything</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this modern world, transferability is no longer a consideration in information flows; a speculative view of the future suggests that distance ceases to be a determinant of the cost and speed of communication, and that this will alter the spatial structure of economic and social decision making</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spatially significant information flows have two types:</span><strong> individual and mass</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (source-to-area); or further subdivided into</span><strong> formal interchange</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (need for an interposed channel) and</span><strong> informal</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (no such carrier)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual communication: each individual develops a p</span><strong>ersonal communication field </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(informational counterpart of that person&rsquo;s activity space)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mass communication: formal, structure transmission of information in a one-way flow between single points of origin and broad areas of reception- &ldquo;space filling;&rdquo; the number and location of points are related to their spatial coverage characteristics, minimum size of area and population, and capability of audience reaction; coverage area determined by both nature of medium and corporate intent of agency</span></p>
<p><strong>Place perception</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- awareness we have as individuals of home and distant places and beliefs we hold about them; involves our feelings and understanding, reasoned or irrational, about the natural and cultural characteristics of an area and its opportunity structure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decisions people make are based not on reality but their assumptions and impressions of reality</span><strong>-Perception of environment and perception of natural hazards</strong></p>
<p><strong>Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the permanent or planned long-term relocation of residential place and activity space</span></p>
<p><strong>Intercontinental movements and interregional migrations: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">involve movements between countries and within countries, in response to individual or group assessments of improved economic prospects, but often reflecting flight from difficult or dangerous environmental or other conditions</span></p>
<p><strong>Rural to urban migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- movement from agricultural areas to cities</span></p>
<p><strong>Forced migrations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- relocation decisions made solely and entirely by people other than migrants</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reluctant relocation- less than fully voluntary migration</span></p>
<p><strong>Voluntary migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- represents individual response to the factors influencing all spatial interaction decision</span></p>
<p><strong>Involuntary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Push and pull factors-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> negative conditions that impel the decision to migrate and positive attractions of the migration destination</span></p>
<p><strong>Place utility-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> measure of an individual&rsquo;s satisfaction with a given residential location; the decision t migrate is a reflection of the appraisal/perception by the prospective migrant</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In deciding, the decision maker considers not only perceived value of present location but expected place utility of potential destinations</span></p>
<p><strong>Aspiration level</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- level of accomplishment the person sees for himself- adjusted to what is attainable</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spatial search- process by which locational alternatives are evaluated</span></p>
<p><strong>Step migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- involves place transition from, for example, rural to central city residence through small not extreme locational changes: first fam to small town, then to major city</span></p>
<p><strong>Chain migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- assures mover is part of established migrant flow from a common origin to a prepared destination</span></p>
<p><strong>Counter/Return migration-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people who return to their place of origin; within the US, return migration is defined as moving back to state of birth- 20% of all domestic moves</span></p>
<p><strong>Migration fields-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> areas that dominate a locale&rsquo;s in and out migration patterns</span></p>
<p><strong>Channelized Migration/ pattern of flow-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channels link areas that are in some way tied to one another by past migrations, economic trade considerations, or other affinities</span></p>
<p><strong>Circular migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- migrant workers entering and leaving at will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voluntary migration is responsive to controls that influence all forms of spatial interaction. Push and pull factors are related to complementarity; costs (emotional and financial) of a residence relocation are expressions of transferability. Large cities exert a stronger migrant pull, a reflection of the gravity model. Distance Decay has often been noted in migration studies. Movers seek to minimize friction of distance. For groups for whom push factors are more determining than destination pulls are likely to limit their migration distance in response to encountered apparent opportunities, which makes them affected by intervening opportunities. Hierarchical migration helps explain movement decisions. </span></p>
<p><strong>Relevant laws of migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by E.G. Ravenstein:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Most migrants go only a short distance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Longer-distance migration favors big city destinations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Most migration proceeds step by step</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Most migration is rural to urban</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ech migration flow produces a counterflow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Most migrants are adults, families are less likely to make international moves</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Most international migrants are young males</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- ? On average emigrants tend to be relatively well-educated</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Americans, migration involves: change in life course, changes in career course, changes of residence associated with individual personality</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work related relocations are most important in US long-distance</span><strong> (intercounty) </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">migrations, and in both </span><strong>intra and interstate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relocations, more migrants move down to the urban hierarchy than vice versa; pattern of deconcentration reflects modern transportation and communication technologies, more and younger retirees, and the attractions of amenity-rich smaller places; some people move often for no reason, while</span><strong> stayers </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">settle into communities permanently</span></p>
<p><strong>- Biased innovations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- diffuse according to social context rather than spatial context</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-4">Chapter 4: Population - World Patterns, Regional Trends</h2>

<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 4 &ldquo;Population: World Patterns, Regional Trends&rdquo; in Fellmann textbook. We will learn about the meaning and purpose of population cohorts, rates, and other measurements used by geographers. Also, we will learn about the demographic transition model and the demographic equation, world population distributions, densities, and urban components, and population projections, controls, and prospects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now turn our attention to one of the key topics in human geography &ndash; population. With over 7 billion people living on the Earth today, we realize the importance of studying the delicate balance between population and the limited resources we have at our disposal. &nbsp;As we have already seen in last week&rsquo;s Kuby and in the videos assigned, societies deal with population pressures in different ways &ndash; some less acceptable than others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we will learn how population is distributed, what density implies, and the role of fertility and mortality rates on a country&rsquo;s population. &nbsp;We will see how a region&rsquo;s carrying capacity influences the wellbeing of its people. &nbsp;We will also learn how to interpret population pyramids and what the demographic transition model tells us in theory!</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- &nbsp;Inflexible population reality: the structure of the present controls the content of the future</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The size, characteristics, growth trends, and migrations of today&rsquo;s populations help shape the well being of peoples yet unborn but whose numbers and distributions are now being determined</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The numbers, age, and sex distribution of people; patterns and trends in their fertility and mortality; and their density of settlement and rate of growth all affect and are affected by the social, political, and economic organization of a society</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Through population data, we begin to understand how the people in a given area live, how they interact, how they use land, what pressure on resources exists, and what the future may bring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Population geography-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focuses on the number, composition, and distribution of human beings in relation to variations in the conditions of earth space</span></p>
<p><strong>- Demography- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the statistical study of human population</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Spatial analysis</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the relationship of numbers to area</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Regional circumstances of resource base, type of economic development, level of living, food supply, and conditions of health and well being are basic to geography&rsquo;s population concerns; they are also fundamental expressions of the human-environmental relationships that are the substance of all human geographic inquiry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The world&rsquo;s ten most populous countries are mostly found in the developing regions of the world; unless we have some grasp of the scale and meaning of numbers, our understanding of data and data manipulations of the population geographer can at best be superficial</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- On a worldwide basis, populations grow only one way: The number of births in a period exceeds the number of deaths</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ignoring the regional population changes resulting from migration, we can conclude that observed and projected increases in population result from the failure of natural controls to limit the number of births or to increase the number of deaths or from the success of human ingenuity in circumventing such controls when they exist</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Current estimates of slowing population growth and eventual stability or decline in world totals clearly indicate that humans by their individual and collective decisions may effectively limit growth and control global population numbers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- All demographers start their calculations with a count of events; to make these figures more meaningful and useful in population analysis, they use rates and cohort measures</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Rates</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- record the frequency of occurrence of an event during a given time frame for a designated population</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Cohort measures</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- refer data to a population group unified by a specified common characteristic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Crude Birth Rate </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CBR)- often referred to as the birth rate; annual number of live births per 1000 population; called crude because it relates births to total population without regard to the age or sex composition of that population, by the customs and family size expectations of its inhabitants, and by its adopted population policies; high, low, and transitional birth rates- 30 and above, less than 18, 18-30; this may display such regional variability because of differences in age and sex composition or disparities in births among the reproductive age, rather than total population. It is crude because its denominator contains persons who have no chance at all of giving birth- males, young girls, old women</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Total Fertility Rate (TFR</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">)- more refined and more satisfactory statement than CBR for showing the rate and probability of reproduction among fertile females; tells the average number of children that would be born to each woman if during her childbearing years, she bore children at the current year&rsquo;s rate for women that age; this minimizes the effects of fluctuation in the population structure and summarizes the demonstrated and expected reproductive behavior of women; a more useful and reliable figure for regional comparative and predictive purposes</span></p>
<p><strong>- Replacement level fertility</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- level of fertility at which each successive generation of women produce exactly enough children to ensure that the same number of women survive to have offspring themselves; the higher the level of mortality, the higher the replacement level of fertility</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Demographers have long assumed that recently observed developing country and global fertility rate dclines to the replacement level would continue and in the long run lead to stable population numbers; however, nothing requires population stability at any level</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Different TFR estimates imply conflicting population projections and vastly different regional and world population concerns; cultural value changes in favor of children can cause growth to resume</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Individual country projections based on current fertility rates may not accurately anticipate population levels in the near future; massive international population movements are occurring in response to political instabilities and to differentials in perceived economic opportunities; resulting migration flows may cause otherwise declining national populations to stabilize and even grow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Crude Death Rate </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CDR)- also called mortality rate- calculated in the same way as the crude birth rate: the annual number of events per 1000 population</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Highest rates (over 20) are usually found in less developed countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and lowest rates (less than 10) are found in developed states of Europe and Anglo America; that correlation became invalid following World War II</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Death rates are meaningful for comparative purposes only when we study identically structured populations; to overcome that lack of comparability, death rates can be calculated for specific age groups</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Infant Mortality rate- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">ratio of deaths of infants aged 1 year or under per 1000 live births; these rates are significant because it is at these ages that the greatest declines in mortality have occurred as a result of the increased availability of health services</span></p>
<p><strong>- Population pyramid</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a graphic device that represents a population&rsquo;s age and sex composition; the pyramid describes the diagram&rsquo;s shape for many countries in the 1800&rsquo;s when the display was created: a broad base of younger age groups and a progressive narrowing toward the apex as older populations were thinned by death; now many different shapes are formed, each reflecting a different population history and some suggest population profile is a more appropriate label; by grouping several generations of people, they pyramids or profiles highlight the impact of baby booms, population reducing wars, birth rate reductions, and external migrations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the age distribution of national populations reflects the past, records the present, and foretells the future</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the population profile provides a quickly visualized demographic picture of immediate practical and predictive value; as the profile of a national population changes, differing demands are placed on a country&rsquo;s social and economic systems</span></p>
<p><strong>- Dependency ratio</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a simple measure of the number of economic dependents, old or young, that each 100 people in the productive years (15-64) must support</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Knowledge of a country&rsquo;s sex and age distributions also enables demographers to forecast its future population levels, though the reliability of projections decreases with increasing length of forecast; a country with a high proportion of young people will experience a high rate of natural increase unless there is a very high mortality rate among infants and juveniles or fertility and birth rates change</span></p>
<p><strong>- Rate of Natural Increase</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- derived by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate; natural means that increases or decreases due to migration are not included; this rate is usually expressed as a percentage- rate per 100</span></p>
<p><strong>- Doubling time-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the time it takes for a population to double if the present growth rate remains constant</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Population doubling time can be estimated by applying the </span><strong>RUle of 72-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dividing 72 by the growth rate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Even small annual additions accumulate to large total increments because we are dealing with geometric or exponential rather than arithmetic growth; the ever-increasing world base population has reached such a size that each additional doubling results in an astronomical increase in the total</span></p>
<p><strong>- J-curve- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">when the projection population shows exponential growth; important because if the population grows exponentially our resource use will go up exponentially and so will our use as well as a greater demand for food and more; a growth curve that depicts exponential growth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- INdividual country growth is also dependent on patterns of immigration and emigration and of changes in life expectancy; a country&rsquo;s n</span><strong>atural population growth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based solely on births and deaths may yield significantly lower population projections and longer doubling times than does that same country&rsquo;s </span><strong>overall growth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taking migration into account</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Demographic transition model-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 5 stages- attempt to summarize an observed voluntary relationship between population growth and economic development; traces changing levels of human fertility and mortality presumably associated with industrialization and urbanization; over time, high birth and death rates will gradually be replaced by low rates; pages 102 to 1070</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Migration involves the long distance movement of people from one residential location to another; when that relocation occurs across political boundaries, it affects the population structure of both the origin and destination jurisdictions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- DEmographic equation- summarizes the contribution made to regional population change over time by the combination of natural change (difference between births and deaths) and net migration (difference between in migration and out migration); on a global scale, all population change is accounted for by natural change, but the impact of migration increases as the population size of the areal unit studied decreases</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Where cross border movements are big enough, migration may have an impact on the demographic equation and result in significant changes in the population structures of both the origin and destination regions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We can draw generalizing conclusions from the uneven but far from irrational distribution of population:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 90% of people lie north of the equator and two thirds of the total dwell in the mid-latitudes between 20 and 60 degrees </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large majority of the world&rsquo;s inhabitants occupy only a small part of its land surface; more than half live on about 5% of land, two thirds on 10%, and nine tenths on less than 20%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People congregate in lowland areas; their numbers decrease sharply with increases in elevation- because of temperature, length of growing season, slope and erosion problems, and oxygen reductions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although low lying areas are preferred settlement locations, not all areas are equally favored; continental margins have attracted the densest settlement</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Four areas of great clusters of population</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: East Asia, South Asia, Europe, and northeastern US/southeastern Canada</span></p>
<p><strong>- Ecumene- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">permanently inhabited areas of the earth&rsquo;s surface</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Nonecumene/Anecumene</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- uninhabited or very sparsely occupied zone</span></p>
<p><strong>- Population density-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the relationship between the number of inhabitants and the area they occupy</span></p>
<p><strong>- Crude density/Arithmetic density-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most common and least satisfying expression of the regional variations of human distribution; the calculation of the number of people per unit area of land, within the boundaries of a political entity</span></p>
<p><strong>- Physiological density-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an expression of population pressure exerted on agricultural land; when total population is divided by arable land area alone</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Agricultural density</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- excludes city populations from the physiological density calculation and reports the number of rural residents per unit of agriculturally productive land; an estimate of the pressure of people on the rural areas</span></p>
<p><strong>- Overpopulation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an observation or conviction that an environment or territory is unable adequately to support its present population; reflection of carrying capacity</span></p>
<p><strong>- Under-population</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the circumstance of too few people to sufficiently develop the resources of a country or region to improve the level of living</span></p>
<p><strong>- Urbanization</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- transformation from rural to urban status by individual state&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;urban&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>- Population Projections-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates of future population size, age, and sex composition based on current data</span></p>
<p><strong>- Thomas Robert Malthus</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- English economist and demographer; put the problem of population control in a treatise published in 1798: all biological populations have a potential for increase that exceeds the actual rate of increase, and the resources for the support of increase are limited</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Population is inevitably limited by the means of subsistence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Populations invariably increase with increase in the means of subsistence unless prevented by powerful checks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The checks that inhibit the reproductive capacity of populations and keep it in balance with means of subsistence are either private or destructive</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> S-curve</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- top represents a population size consistent with and supportable by the exploitable resource base; A display of cumulative costs, labor hours or other quantities plotted against time. The name derives from the S-like shape of the curve, flatter at the beginning and end and steeper in the middle, which is typical of most projects.</span></p>
<p><strong>- Homeostatic plateau</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- when the population is equivalent to the carrying capacity of the occupied area; states of equilibrium</span></p>
<p><strong>- Neo-Malthusianism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">underpinning of national and international programs of population limitation primarily through birth control and family planning</span></p>
<p><strong>- Cornucopians-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believed that population growth is a stimulus, not a deterrent, to development and that human minds and skills are the world&rsquo;s ultimate resource base</span></p>
<p><strong>- Population demographic momentum</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the tendency for a growing population to continue growing after a fertility decline because once this happens a country moves to a different stage in the demographic transition model.</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-5">Chapter 5: Language And Religion - Mosaics Of Culture</h2>

<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religion leaves an imprint on landscape, through culture and lifestyle. Religious structures - such as places of worship, and other sacred sites - dominate many landscapes. Religious traditions - Hindu ritual bathing in the Ganges, for example - leave their mark on the physical appearance of an area. Religious observance - church attendance, and so on - affect the time management, spatial movements and behavior of believers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language is one of the cornerstones of national identity, cultural unity, and community cohesion. It is the most important cultural glue&mdash;an aspect that binds a culture together&mdash;because without language, there would he no culture. People have very strong feelings about their language and identify with it (people may be persuaded to change their religion, but not their language). When a people&rsquo;s language is threatened, the response is often passionate and protective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of languages are spoken in the world today (linguists estimate between 5000 and 6000) and they serve as both unifiers and dividers of humanity. Ironically, all languages may have a common origin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 5- Language and Religion: Mosaics of Culture in Fellmann textbook. &nbsp;Learn about the classification, spread, and distribution of the world languages. Learn the role of religion in culture and the origins, nature, and diffusion of principal world religions.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Language and religion:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> distinguishing characteristics of cultures and cultural landscapes; two prominent threads in the tapestry of cultural diversity; the basic components of cultures, the learned ways of life of different human communities; they help identify who and what we are and clearly place us within larger communities of persons with similar characteristics; they also divide and separate people of different tongues and faiths</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Language and religion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are mentifacts of the ideological subsystem that help shape the belief system of a society and transmit it to succeeding generations; they are fundamental strands both within and between cultures in the complex web of culture, serving to shape and distinguish people and groups</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In their present day structure and spatial patterns they are ever changing strands- temporary latest phase in a continuing progression of culture change</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Language</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- evolves in place, responds to the dynamics of human thought, experience, and expression and to the exchanges and borrowings ever more common in a closely integrated world- disperse in space, carried by streams of migrants, colonizations, and conquerors- may be rigorously defended and preserved as essential elements of cultural identity or abandoned in the search for acceptance in a new society; to trace their diffusions, adoptions, and disappearances is to understand part of the evolving course of historical cultural geography</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Religions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- dynamic, sweeping across national, linguistic, and cultural boundaries by conversion, conviction, and conquest; their broad boundaries are fundamental in defining culture realms and different scale religious differences contribute to cultural diversity and richness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Forever changing and evolving, language in spoken or written form makes possible the cooperative efforts, the group understandings, and shared behavior patterns that distinguish culture groups- the most important medium by which culture is transmitted; it also structures the perceptions of a society- by the words it contains and the concepts it formulates, language determines the attitudes,understandings, and responses of the society to which it belongs- cultural heterogeneity- cultural diversity- symbol of cultural identity that distinguishes the world&rsquo;s diverse social groups</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Language</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: an organized system of spoken words by which people communicate with each other with mutual comprehension</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Language family:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a group of languages descended from a single, earlier tongue (ie. Latin to Romance languages)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Protolanguage-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reconstructed earlier form of a word- determines a word&rsquo;s original form before it underwent alteration and divergence in vocabulary, grammar, and sound changes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Genetic classification</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- classification of languages by origin and historical relationship</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the present world distribution of major language families records not only the migrations and conquests of our linguistic ancestors but also the continuing dynamic pattern of human movements, settlements, and colonizations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Language spread</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the increase or relocation through time in the area over which a language is spoken</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Dispersion of speakers and acquisition of speakers represents spatial diffusion: massive population relocation in which culture is transported to and made dominant in a new territory is an example of relocation diffusion; discernment and adoption of a new language by native speakers of another tongue is a form of expansion diffusion with acculturation; hierarchical diffusion can also be seen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Language spread can be impeded by barriers or promoted by their absence; </span><strong>cultural barriers and physical barriers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may retard or prevent language adoption</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Migration, segregation, and isolation give rise to separate, mutually unintelligible languages because the society speaking the parent protolanguage no longer remains unitary; comparable changes occur within a single language in word meaning, pronunciation, vocabulary, and </span><strong>syntax</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the way words are put together in phrases and sentences); changes can be both gradual and cumulative, or massive and abrupt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Speech community-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made up of people who speak a common language &nbsp;az</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Standard language</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- comprises the accepted community norms of syntax, vocabulary, pronunciation, and distinctive dialects reflecting the ordinary speech of areal, social, professional, or other subdivisions of the general population</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a dialect can become the standard language through identity with the speech of prestigious, high-raking, and powerful members of the larger speech community, and also a rich literary tradition; the dialect that emerges as the basis is often the one identified with its capital or center of power at the time of national development </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In many societies, populations have two languages: regional dialect of home or daily life, and standard language used in more formal situations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Dialect</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- recognizable speech variants</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Social dialect</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- denotes social class and educational level</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Vernacular</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">-nonstandard language or dialect native to the locale or adopted by the social group</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Linguistic geography</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- study of character and spatial pattern of dialects and languages</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Isogloss-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outer limit of a dialect features occurrence (the term isophon is used if the areal variant is marked by difference in sound rather than word choice; together isoglosses give clear map evidence of dialect regions that in turn reflect topographic barriers and corridors, long-established political borders, or past migration flows and diffusions of word choice and pronunciation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Geographic/regional dialects</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- recognized at different scales- world and regional</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Pidgin</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- amalgam of languages, usually a simplified form of one- second language for anyone who uses it; a language generally restricted to such specific functions as commerce, administration, or work supervision; characterized by a highly simplified grammatical structure and a sharply reduced vocabulary adequate to express basic ideas but not complex concepts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Creole- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a pidgin becomes the first language of a group of speakers. Creole languages have proved useful integrative tools in the linguistically diverse areas; several have become symbols of nationhood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Lingua Franca- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">established language used habitually for communication by people whose native tongues are mutually incomprehensible. Literally &ldquo;frankish tongue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Second language- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A language learned in addition to the native tongue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Official Language- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(national) Required language of instruction in the official/semiofficial public and private activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Multilingualism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two or more languages in common use in a society. May reflect significant cultural and spatial divisions within a country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Bilingualism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">two official languages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Monolingual- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">only a single language of communication for all purposes among all citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Toponyms/Toponymy- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toponyms are place names. Language on the land, the record of past inhabitants whose namings endure, perhaps corrupted and disguised, as reminds of their existence and their passing. Toponymy is the study of place names, a special interest of linguistic geography. Place names become a part of the cultural landscape that remains long after the name givers have passed from the scene. </span></p>
<p><strong>- Place Name Parts- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place names, whatever their language of origin, frequently consist of two parts: </span><strong>generic</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (classifying) and </span><strong>specific </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(modifying or particular). The order, however, may alter between languages and give a clue to the group originally bestowing the place names. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Religion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like language, religion is a symbol of group identity and a cultural rallying point. Unlike language, which is an attribute of all people, religion varies in its cultural role. Value systems (see below) are termed religions when it involves systems of formal or informal worship and faith in the sacred and divine. May be viewed as a unified system of beliefs and practices that join all those who adhere to them into a single moral community. May intimately affect all facets of a culture. An element of the ideological subsystem: formalized and organized religion is also an institutional expression of the sociological subsystem. As well as strongly influence attitudes toward the tools and rewards of the technological subsystem. Religions are cultural innovations. May be unique to a single culture group, closely related to the faiths professed in nearby areas, or derived from or identical to belief systems spatially far removed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Value System- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common beliefs, understandings, expectations, and controls that unite their members and set them off from other, different culture groups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Monotheism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belief in a single deity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Polytheism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belief in many gods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Religious categories- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">universalizing, ethnic, or tribal (traditional). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Universalizing religions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">faiths that claim applicability to all humans and proselytize; seek to transmit their beliefs through missionary work and conversion. Membership in universalizing religions is open to anyone who chooses to make some sort of symbolic commitment. No one is excluded because of nationality, ethnicity, or previous religious belief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Ethnic religions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">have strong territorial and cultural group identification. One usually becomes a member of an ethnic religion by birth or by adoption of a complex lifestyle and cultural identity, not by simple declaration of faith. Do not usually proselytize, and their members form distinctive closed communities identified with a particular ethnic group or political unit. Integral element of a specific culture; to be part of the religion is to be immersed in the totality of the culture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Tribal, or traditional religions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">special forms of ethnic religions distinguished by their small size, their unique identity with localized culture groups not yet fully absorbed into modern society, and their close ties to nature. Two beliefs: &nbsp;</span><strong>Animism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">life exists in all objects, or that such inanimate objects are the abode of the dead, of spirits, and of gods. </span><strong>Shamanism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">form of tribal religion that involves community acceptance of a shaman, a religious leader, healer, and worker of magic, who, through special powers, can intercede with and interpret the spirit world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Fundamentalism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">any religious orthodoxy that is revivalist and ultra-conservative in nature. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-6">Chapter 6: Ethnic Geography - Threads Of Diversity</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we are still learning about Culture but are focusing on ethnic groups and ethnic diversity. Each one of us belongs to one or more ethnic groups and we share important attributes with these groups. Our ethnic identity cannot be chosen, changed, or ignored as we can do with our language or religion. Ethnic identities are a source of pride to most people because it links one with countless generations of humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important concept to grasp is the difference between ethnicity and race. These two concepts are constantly confused but you will soon understand the distinction and never again misuse the two terms!!!! :)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethnicity and race are two important characteristics of a group of people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethnicity is identity with a group of people who share the cultural traditions of a certain homeland or hearth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Race is identity with a group of people who share a biological ancestor.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As geographers, we are more interested in ethnicity because its characteristics are tied to place. Race is a concept closely linked to Biology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 6 &ldquo;Ethnic Geography: Threads of Diversity&rdquo; in Fellmann textbook. We will learn about ethnicity, ethnic diversity, and changing immigration streams to the United States. We will discuss acculturation, ethnic clusters, and international ethnic situations and how they are handled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -</span><strong>Ethnic Groups- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Populations that feel themselves bound together by a common origin and set off from other groups by ties of culture, race, religion, language, or nationality. Associated with clearly recognizable territories-either larger homeland districts or smaller rural and urban enclaves-in which they are primary or exclusive occupants and upon which they have placed distinctive cultural marks. Composed of individuals who share some prominent cultural traits or characteristics, some evident physical or social identifications setting them apart both from the majority population and from other distinctive minorities among whom they may live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Like linguistic and religious differences within societies, such population inter minglings are masked by the &ldquo;culture realms&rdquo; but at a larger scale are important threads in the cultural geographic web of our complex world</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Ethnic Diversity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A near-universal part of human geographic patterns.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnic Geography- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject: the multiple movements, diffusions, migrations, and mixings of peoples of different origins making up that world; its concern are those of spatial distributions and interactions of ethnic groups, of the cultural characteristics and influences underlying them, and of how the built environment reflects the imprint of various ethnic groups</span></p>
<p><strong>- Culture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the composite of traits making up the way of life of a human group- collective beliefs, symbols, values, forms of behavior, and complexes of such nonmaterial and material traits as social customs, language, religion, food habits, tools, structures, and the like; culture is learned- characterize the group that have collectively created and transmitted to its children other ways of life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Ethnicity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply the summary term of identification assigned to a large group of people recognized as sharing the traits of a distinctive common culture (in contrast to culture itself). Always based on a firm understanding by members of a group that they are in some fundamental ways different from others who do not share their distinguishing characteristics or cultural heritage. &nbsp;At root, a spatial concept. Inseparable from territory; became an important concern in the cultural patterning of space and clearly and item of human geographic interest. Often identified with language or religious practices setting a minority group off from a surrounding majority culture. A term derived from the Greek word ethnos, meaning a people or nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Distinctive culture groups partition space and place their claims and imprints on it; the durability of ethnic distinction even under conditions and national myths that emphasize intermixing and homogenization of population as the accepted norm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Race vs. Ethnicity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequently equated with each other, but are actually very different concepts (see below for race and above for ethnicity). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Race- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">usually understood to be a population subset whose members have in common some hereditary biological characteristics that set them apart physically from other human groups. Outdated categorization of humans based on outward physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, or eye color or shape; does not exist in a scientific biological sense but does persist as an idea and basis for group identity and racism/prejudice/discrimination</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- No single trait denotes ethnicity; race is not a meaningful way to describe human variation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Group recognition may be based on language, religion, national origin, unique customs; common unifying bonds of ethnicity are a shared ancestry and cultural heritage, distinctive traditions, territorial identification, and sense of community</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Ethnocentrism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term describing a tendency to evaluate other cultures against the standards of one&rsquo;s own. It implies the feeling that one&rsquo;s own ethnic group is superior. &nbsp;This can divide multiethnic societies by establishing rivalries and provoking social and spatial discord and isolation; it can also be a sustaining and identifying emotion, giving familiar values and support to the individual in strange and complex surroundings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Territorial isolation/identity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong and supporting trait of ethnic separatism and assists individual groups to retain their identification; inseparable from ethnicity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Where ethnic groups are intermixed and territorial boundaries imprecise, or where a single state contains disparate rival populations, conflict among groups can be serious if peaceful relations or central government control break down;</span><strong> ethnic cleansing</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (through mass genocide the violent elimination of a target ethnic group from a particular geographic or political area to achieve racial or cultural homogeneity and expanded settlement area by the perpetrating state or ethnic group; results in an alteration of the ethnic composition of regions and states and also and ethnic mix in adjacent areas and countries to which assaulted and displaced populations fled as refugees) has become a past or present justification and objective for civil conflict; </span></p>
<p><strong>-Natural selection/adaptation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">favors the transmission of characteristics that enable humans to adapt to a particular environment, such as climate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Genetic drift- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike natural selection, genetic drift differentiates populations in non-adaptive ways. Natural selection and genetic drift promote differentiation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gene flow- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countering natural selection and genetic drift, which promote differentiation. Via interbreeding. Acts to homogenize neighboring populations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Host Society- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">established, dominant group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Amalgamation theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">formal term for the traditional melting pot concept of the merging of many immigrant ethnic heritages into a composite American mainstream. More recently been rejected by many as unrealistic in light of current widespread social and cultural tensions. Recent experience in destination areas of multiple immigration flows indicates that strongly retained and defended ethnic identities are increasingly the rule and that a militant multiculturalism rather than voluntary amalgamation is a more realistic description of current conditions; the old melting pot concept has largely dissolved, replaced with a greater emphasis on preserving the diverse cultural heritages of the country&rsquo;s many ethnic components</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- All new immigrant groups found a controlling host group culture in place, with accustomed patterns of behavior and response and a dominant language of the workplace and government; the customs and practices familiar and expected among those already in place had to be learned by newcomes</span></p>
<p><strong>-Acculturation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adoption by the immigrants of the values, attitudes, ways of behavior, and speech of the receiving society. In the process, the ethnic group loses much of its separate cultural identity as it accepts over time the culture of the larger host community; usually involves a minority group adopting the patterns of the dominant population but the process can be reciprocal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Assimilation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the gradual integration of the new arrivals into the economic and cultural mainstream of American society occurs. Full assimilation may be seen as a two-part process. Does not necessarily mean that ethnic consciousness or awareness of racial and cultural differences is lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Behavioral/cultural assimilation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">rough equivalent of acculturation; implies integration into a common cultural life through shared experience, language, intermarriage, and sense of history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Structural assimilation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">fusion of immigrant ethnics within the groups, social systems, and occupations of the host society and the adoption of common attitudes and values. A two-way street- requires immigrant groups to absorb majority cultural values and practices but also demands that the majority society give full and unrestricted acceptance to members of the minority group and allow them to rise to positions of authority and power</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The extent of structural assimilation is measured by the degree of residential segregation that sets off the minority group from the larger general community, and employment segregation and intermarriage rates</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Most indicative of full structural assimilation is election or appointment to high public office and business leadership positions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Assimilation does not necessarily mean that ethnic consciousness or awareness of racial and cultural differences is lost</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Competition theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suggests that as ethnic minorities begin to achieve success and enter into mainstream social and economic life, awareness of ethnic differences may be heightened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ethnic identity may be most clearly experienced and expressed by those who can most successfully assimilate but who choose to promote group awareness and ethnic mobilization movements; that promotion is a reflection of pressures of american urban life and the realities of increased competition; those pressures transform formerly isolated groups into recognized self assertive ethnic minorities pursuing goals and interests dependent on their position within the larger society</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Throughout much of the world, the close association of territoriality and ethnicity is well recognized, accepted, and often politically disruptive; indigenous ethnic groups have developed over time in specific locations and through ties of kinship, language, culture, religion, and shared history, have established themselves in their own and others&rsquo; eyes as distinctive peoples with defined homeland areas</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The boundaries of most countries of the world encompass a number of racial or ethnic minorities, whose demands for special territorial recognition have increased rather than diminished with advances in economic development, education, and self awareness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The spatial pattern of ethnicity that has developed is more intricate and shifting than in many other pluralistic societies; it is not based on absolute ethnic dominance but on interplay between a majority culture and several competing minority groups; it shows the enduring consequences of early settlement and the changing structure of a fluid, responsive, freely mobile society</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>First effective settlement- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of that imprint of ethnic groups on particular areas, what the geographer Wilbur Zelinsky termed. A doctrine. That principle holds that whenever an empty territory undergoes settlement or an earlier population is dislodged by invaders, the specific characteristics of the first group able to effect a viable, self-perpetuating society are of crucial significance for the later social and cultural geography of the area, no matter how tiny the initial band of settlers may have been. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Charter group- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">dominant first arrivals establishing the cultural norms and standards against which other immigrant groups were measured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Ethnic islands- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispersed and rural counterparts of urban ethnic neighborhoods; areas of ethnic concentration; characterized by strong sense of community; frequently placed their distinctive imprint on the rural landscape by retaining home country barn and house styles and farmstead layouts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Cluster migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">sizable extents of rural territory received the imprint of a group of immigrants acting in concert. Was not unique to foreign colonies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Chain migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the assemblage in one area of the relatives, friends, or unconnected compatriots of the first arrivals, attracted both by favorable reports and by familiar presences in specific locales. Caused some ethnic concentrations of Anglo America;might not affect sizable districts but did place a distinctive imprint on restricted rural ethnic islands and particularly urban areas</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Ethnic provinces- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entire regions become associated with larger ethnic or racial aggregations numbering in the thousands or millions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Social distance- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">immigrant neighborhoods are a measure of it. Separates the minority from the charter group; the greater the perceived differences, the greater the social distance and the less likely is the charter group to easily accept or assimilate the newcomer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Segregation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shorthand expression for the extent to which members of an ethnic group are not uniformly distributed in relation to the rest of the population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Index of residential dissimilarity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as the segregation index. A commonly employed measure quantifying the degree to which a distinctive group is segregated. It indicates the percentage difference between the distribution of two component groups of a population, with a theoretical range of values from 0 (no segregation) to 100 (complete segregation). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Worldwide, the degree in immigrant segregation is at least in part conditioned by the degree of social distance felt between the newcomer population and the other immigrant and host societies among whom residential space is sought</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Constraints on assimilation and the extent of discrimination and segregation are greater for some minorities than for others; the rate of assimilation of an ethnic minority by the host culture depends on two sets of controls:</span><strong> external</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including attitudes toward the minority held by the charter group and other competing ethnic groups, and </span><strong>internal</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> controls of group cohesiveness and defensiveness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> External Controls:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When the majority culture or rival minorities perceive an ethnic group as threatening, the group tends to be spatially isolated by external blocking tactics designed to confine the rejected minority and to resist its invasion of already occupied urban neighborhoods; the more tightly knit the threatened group, the more adamant and overt are its resistance tactics</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Tipping point- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">That level (read on): when confrontation measures fail, the invasion of a charter-group territory buy the rejected minority proceeds until a critical percentage of newcomer housing occupancy is reached. That level. May precipitate a rapid exodus by the former majority population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Invasion, followed by succession, then results in a new spatial pattern of ethnic dominance according to models of urban social geography designed for american cities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Internal Controls- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although part of the American pattern of urban residential segregation may be explained by the external controls of host culture resistance and discrimination, the clustering of specific groups into discrete, ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods is best understood as the result of internal controls of group defensiveness and conservatism; the self-elected segregation of ethnic groups (ethnic neighborhoods) can be seen to serve four principal functions-defense, support, preservation, and attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Defense- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduces individual immigrant isolation and exposure by physical association within a limited area. Their own defined ethnic territory provides members of the group with security from the hostility of antagonistic social groups</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Support- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a variety of ways. The area serves as a halfway station between the home country and the alien society, to which admittance will eventually be sought. It acts as a place of initiation and indoctrination, providing supportive lay and religious ethnic institutions, familiar businesses, job opportunities where language barriers are minimal, and friendship and kinship ties to ease the transition to a new society. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Preservation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting the ethnic group&rsquo;s positive intent to preserve and promote such essential elements of its cultural heritage as language and religion. Represents a disinclination to be totally absorbed into the charter society and a desire to maintain those customs and associations seen to be essential to the conversation of the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Assertion/Attack- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A peaceful and legitimate search for, particularly, political representation by a concentration of electoral power; concerted efforts to achieve the promotion of group interests at all governmental levels</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ethnic communities once established are not permanent; second generation neighborhoods usually become far more mixed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ethnic congregations initially identified with particular central city areas are frequently or usually displaced by different newcomer groups; with recent diversified immigration, older homogeneous ethnic neighborhoods have become highly subdivided and polyethnic; the new ethnic neighborhoods are intermixed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Increasing ethnic diversity coupled with continuing immigration flow has in some instances expanded rather than reduced patterns of urban group segregation; the tendency for separate ethnic groups to cluster for security, economic, and social reasons cannot be effective if a great many relatively small numbers of different ethnic groups find themselves in a single city setting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Intermixture is inevitable when individual groups do not achieve the critical mass necessary to establish a true identifiable separate community; but as continuing immigration and natural increase allow groups to expand in size, they are able to create more distinctive self selected ethnic clusters and communities; immigration growth yields not only greater ethnic diversity but also greater evident segregation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Even when an ethnic community rejects or is denied assimilation into the larger society,, it may both relocate and retain its coherence; other growing, older ethnic communities, needing more space and containing newly affluent and successful members able to compete for better housing elsewhere, have followed a similar pattern of subdivision and relocation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Results in </span><strong>ethnoburb</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a full structured socioeconomic and political suburban community with a significant though not necessarily exclusive concentration of a single ethnic group</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When both the charter group and ethnic group perceive the social distance separating them to be small, the isolation caused by external discriminatory and internal cohesiveness controls is temporary, and ethnic residential clusters quickly give way to full assimilation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethnic-cluster/ethnic concentration models:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><strong>Colonies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethnic residential clusters while they endure, may be termed as colonies. Serving essentially as points of entry for members of the particular ethnic group. Persist only to the extent that new arrivals perpetuate the need for them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When an ethnic cluster does persist because its occupants choose to preserve it, their behavior reflects the internal cohesiveness of the group and its desire to maintain and enduring </span><strong>ethnic enclave</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><strong>Ethnic enclave- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">ethnic neighborhood/cluster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><strong>Ghetto- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When an ethnic cluster is perpetuated by external constraints and discriminatory actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Both discrimination and voluntarism determine the changing pattern of ethnic clustering within metropolitan areas; where forced segregation limits residential choices, ethnic or racial minorities may be confined to the older low cost housing areas, close to the city center; growing ethnic groups that maintain voluntary spatial association frequently expand the area of their dominance by growth outward from the core of the city in a radial pattern</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Early southern ghetto- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre civil war- in the south, the white majority had total control of the housing market and assigned residential space to blacks in accordance with white self interest; African Americans were assigned small dwellings in alleys and backstreets within and bounding the white communities where they worked as house and garden slaves/servants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Classic southern ghetto- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">for newly freed blacks, was composed of specially built, low-quality housing on undesirable land (swampy, near industry or railroads) and was sufficiently far from better quality white housing to maintain full spatial and social segregation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Early northern ghetto- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">toehold location in high density, aged, substandard housing on the margin of the central business district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Classic northern ghetto- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more recent expansion of that initial enclave to surround the CBD and to penetrate, through invasion and succession, contiguous zones as far as the numbers, rent-paying ability, and housing discrimination will allow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Immigrant groups arrive at their destinations with already existing sets of production techniques and skills; they bring established ideas of appropriate dress, foods, and building styles, and they have religious practices, marriage customs, and other cultural expressions in place and ingrained; they carry to their new homes a full complement of artifacts, sociofacts, and mentifacts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- They may modify, abandon, or pass these on to the host culture depending on a number of interacting influences:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The background of the arriving group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its social distance from the charter group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disparity between new home and origin area environmental conditions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance given by the migrants to the economic, political, or religious motivations that caused them to relocate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kinds of encountered constraints that force personal, social, &nbsp;or technical adjustments on the new arrivals</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Culture rebound- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A belated adoption of group consciousness and reestablishment of identifying traits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Land survey- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charter group of any area had the option of designing a system for claiming and allotting land appropriate to its needs and traditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Metes-and-bounds- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">System of property description of the region, based largely on landform or water features or such temporary landscape elements as prominent trees, unusual rocks, or cairns, led to boundary uncertainty and dispute. Often resulted in below. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Topographic road patterns- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">where routes are often controlled by the contours of the land rather than the regularity of a geometric survey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Rectangular survey- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">established survey lines oriented in the cardinal directions and divided the land into townships 6 miles square, which were further subdivided into sections 1 mile on a side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Long-lot- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a surveyed elongated holding typically about 10 times longer than wide, stretching far back from a narrow river frontage. The back of the lot was indicated by a roadway roughly parallel to the line of the river, marking the front of a second series (or range) of long lots. The system had the advantage of providing each settler with a fair access to fertile land along the floodplain, lower-quality river terrace land, and remote poorer-quality back areas on the valley slopes serving as woodlots. Dwellings were built at the front of the holding, in a loose settlement alignment called acote, where access was easy and the neighbors were close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Three principal colonial hearths- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England, South, and Midland.</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-7">Chapter 7: Folk And Popular Culture - Diversity And Uniformity</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 7 &ldquo;Folk and Popular Culture: Diversity and Uniformity&rdquo; in Fellmann textbook. Folk and popular culture are discussed. &nbsp;Folk culture hearths and non-material folk culture in the U.S. are covered as well as the nature and patterns of popular culture and its diffusion and regionalism.</span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>- Three Elements Of Cultural Mosaic-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Folk Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The material and nonmaterial aspects of daily life preserved by smaller groups partially or totally isolated from the mainstream currents of the larger society around them. Often viewed as the absolute opposite of popular or mass culture. Seen as the unchanging, rural way of life, largely relegated to non modern, traditional peoples untouched by outside influences. Where folk culture exists in developed countries like the US, it is regarded as characteristic only of socially or geographically isolated groups. Doomed to eventual extinction by the forces of modernization. The collective heritage of institutions, customs, skills, dress, and way of life of a small, stable, closely knit, usually rural community. Controlled by tradition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Ethnic Groups- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethnic groups provide a second source of diversity in composite societies, each with its distinctive characterizing heritage and traditions and each contributing to the national cultural mix. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Popular Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given time, easy communication, and common interests, it may provide a unifying and liberating color to the kaleidoscopic mix, reducing differences between formerly distinctive groups though perhaps not totally eradicating them. General mass of people, primarily but not exclusively urban based. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Folk Life- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its unaltered form, is a cultural whole composed of both tangible and intangible elements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Material Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">made up of physical, visible things: everything from musical instruments to furniture, tools, and buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Built Environment- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">comprised of material culture; it is the landscape created by humans. Also constitutes the contents of household and workshop. </span></p>
<p><strong>Nonmaterial culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to built environment, is the intangible part, the mentifacts and sociofacts expressed in oral tradition, folk song and folk story, and customary behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Folk Customs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeated, characteristic acts, behavioral patterns, artistic traditions, and conventions regulating social life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Folk Culture Region- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When folk customs and artifacts are distinctively identified with any area long inhabited by a particular group, a folk culture region may be recognized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Mid-Atlantic- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log-building techniques and subsistence lifestyles, furniture styles, log construction, decorative arts, house and barn types, and distinctive sweet cookery were among the purely European imports converted in the Mid-Atlantic hearth to American folk expressions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Lowland South- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derived from English originals and African admixtures. French influences and migrations from the highland areas. Dogtrot and I houses; English cuisine was adapted to include black-eyed peas, turnip greens, sweet potatoes, small-bird pies, and syrups from sugarcane and sorghum. Widespread use of banjo in music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Upland South- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mixture of influences carried up from Tidewater and brought south from the Mid-Atlantic folk by settlers of German and Scotch-Irish stock. Log houses and farm structures, rail fences, traditional art and music, home-crafted quilts and furniture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>North- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">dominated by New England, showed a folk culture of decidedly English origin. Saltbox house and Boston baked beans in pots of redware and stoneware. </span></p>
<p><strong>Midwest- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a conglomerate of inputs from the Upland South, North, and particularly, from the Mid-Atlantic region, is the least distinctive, most intermixed and Americanized of all the cultural regions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Vernacular House Styles- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those built in traditional form but without formal plans or drawings, part of the material culture of early colonists that met new conditions in America. Each separately colonized area produced its own distinctive vernacular housing mix, and a few served eventually as hearth districts from which its imported and developed house forms diffused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>The Northern Hearths- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the north, the St. Lawrence Valley remains one of the few areas with structural reminders of a French occupation that once spread widely but impermanently over eastern North America. There, in French Canada, beginning in the middle of the 17th century, three major house types were introduced, all styles still found in western France today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Southern New England- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the rural southern English colonists who settled here. Heavily framed houses: sturdy posts and stout horizontal beams sided by overlapping clapboards and distinguished by steep roofs and massive chimneys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Hudson Valley- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex mix of Dutch, French, Flemish, English, and German settlers--Dutch were initially dominant. Side-gabled homes, all with a split Dutch door (whose separately opened upper half let air in and closed lower half kept children in and animals out) were characterized by a steep roof, often with flared eaves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Garrison house- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Characteristic second-floor overhang, a relict of medieval European urban house design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Saltbox house- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An asymmetrical gable roof covering a lean-to addition for extra room</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>New England large house- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgian style, had up to ten rooms, a lobby entrance, and paired chimneys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Upright-and-wing/lazy-T house- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">wing represented a one-story extension of a basic gable-front house plan, was diffused widely in both rural and urban areas from western NY into the Middle West. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Middle Atlantic Hearths- </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Delaware Valley, Chesapeake Bay- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethnically diverse sites of vernacular architecture more influential on North American housing styles than any other early settlement areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Log cabin</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- evolved there.</span></p>
<p><strong> -Vernacular four-over-four house-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so called in reference to its basic two-story floor plan with four rooms up and four rooms down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>I house-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a two-story structure one room deep with two rooms on each floor also was introduced there--became prominent in the Upper South and the Lower Middle West in the 19th century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Saddlebag House- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a two-room central chimney design, result of a rectangular pen of four log walls that characteristically stood in tandem with an added second room that joined the first at the chimney end of a house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Dogtrot- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple roofing-over of an open area left separating the two epns facing gable toward gable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Southern Coastal Stream- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third source area in the Lower Chesapeake, spread its remarkably uniform influence southward, diffusing its impact inland along numerous paths into the Upland South. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Delta Stream- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">French and Caribbean influenced, in contrast, was much more restricted and localized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Southern Hearths- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern settlement areas developed housing styles that were adapted to the climatic conditions and ethnic mixes distinguishing those areas from the northern colonial districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Southern Tidewater- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in there, malaria, mosquitoes, and extreme heat plaguing their inland plantations during the summer caused the wealthy to prefer hot-season residence in coastal cities such as Charleston, where sea breezes provided relief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Mississippi Delta- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">area of New Orleans and along the lower Mississippi during the 18th century. Dominated by the French, established it. A second North American culture hearth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Charleston single house- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&rsquo;s name related to its single row of three or four rooms ranged from front to back and lined on the outside of each floor by a long veranda or piazza along one side of the structure. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Shotgun house- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heat and humidity were an environmental problem requiring distinctive housing solutions, one of which was this house, a folk cultural contribution that traces its roots to Africa and an introduction into America by free haitian blacks who settled in the delta before the middle of the 19th century. Became a common residence type for both poor blacks and whites migrating to cities in the South and Midwest in search of employment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Interior and Western hearths- </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Spanish adobe house- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">thick walled, long and single-storied with a flat or low-pitched earth-covered roof entered Anglo America through the Hispanic borderlands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Central-Hall House- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">related to both the I house and the four-over-four house, the dominant house type. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Cuisine- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selection of foods and the style of cookery, one of the most evident and enduring of the elements distinguishing cultural groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Folk Ties- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The close ties of people to environments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>North American Folk Music- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">began as transplants of familiar Old World songs carried by settlers to the New World. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Northern Song Area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">including the Maritime Provinces of Canada, New England, and the Middle Atlantic states, in general featured unaccompanied solo singing in clear, hard tones. Its ballads were close to English originals, and the British connection was continuously renewed by new immigrants, including Scots and Irish. On both sides of the border, the fiddle was featured at dances, and in the states, fife-and-drum bands became common in the early year of the Republic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Southern Backwoods and Appalachian song area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">extending westward to East Texas, involved unaccompanied, high-pitched, and nasal solo singing. The music, based on English tradition and modified by Appalachian hardscrabble life, developed in isolation in upland and lowland settlement areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Western song area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">northern and southern traditions abutted in a transition zone along the Ohio Valley but blended together across the Mississippi to create the Western song area. Factual narrative songs reflected the experiences of cowboy, riverman, sodbuster, and gold seeker. Natural beauty, personal valor, and feminine purity were recurring themes. Many songs appeared as reworked lumberjack ballads of the North or other modifications from the song traditions of the eastern US. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Black folk song tradition- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing out of racial and economic oppression, reflects a union of Anglo American folk song, English country dancing, and West African musical patterns. The African American folk song of the rural South or the northern ghetto was basically choral and instrumental in character; hands and feet were used to establish rhythm. A strong beat, a leader-chorus style, and deep-pitched mellow voices were characteristic. </span></p>
<p><strong>- Folklore- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the oral tradition of a group. Ways of talking and interacting and includes proverbs, prayers, common expressions, and particularly, superstitions, beliefs, narrative tales, and legends. </span></p>
<p><strong>- Folkways- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the learned behavior shared by a society that prescribes accepted and common modes of conduct-become those of the country as a whole as acculturation and popularization dictate the ways of life of all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Popular Culture-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> general mass of people primarily but not exclusively urban based, constantly adopting, conforming to, and quickly abandoning ever changing common modes of behaviors and fads of material and nonmaterial culture</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Placelessness- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the replacement of local identity and variety with a homogeneous and standardized landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Glocalization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes this adaptation of globalized products to fit local contexts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Lifestyle centers- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">hence the name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Neolocalism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the creation and maintenance of a place identity and attachment, that constitutes a rejection of a more homogeneous and uniform national and global culture represented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Claritas Life Segments- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claritas is one of the geodemographic marketers who have mapped and classified American neighborhoods. Claritas has classified America&rsquo;s zip codes into 66 different lifestyle segments. Some include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Shotguns and Pickups- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">young, white working class couples with large families who live in small houses or trailer houses. This group has a median household income of $43,000. They are typically high school graduates and are likely to own pickup trucks, go hunting, shop at Lowes, and read North American Hunter magazine. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Young Digerati- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">affluent young families living in desirable urban neighborhoods. Often have graduate degrees and are early adopters and leaders in the use of new technology. $85,700. Likely to shop at Banana Republic, go snowboarding, watch independent films, and drive hybrid cars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Multi-Culti Mosaic- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower middle class, ethnically diverse families living in immigrant gateway neighborhoods. $35,200. Likely to buy Spanish language music, shop at discount department stores, read Jet and drive a Nissan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Blue Blood Estates- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">wealthy suburban families with a significant percentage of Asian Americans. Professors, business executives. $119,500. Likely to drive expensive European automobiles, read architectural magazines, take ski vacations, and shop at Talbots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Vernacular/popular regions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have reality as part of folk or popular culture rather than as political impositions or scholarly constructs. Physical and cultural regions, regions have reality in their minds and are collectively agreed on. </span></p>

<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 8 &ldquo;Livelihood and Economy: Primary Activities&rdquo; in Fellmann textbook. Learn about the types of agriculture &ndash; subsistence, commercial and the models such as Von Thunen&rsquo;s Land Use Model, that are used in analysis. Learn about other primary non-farming economic activities such as fishing, trapping, mining, and forestry.</span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>-Economic Geography- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study of how people earn their living, how livelihood systems vary by area, and how economic activities are spatially interrelated and linked. Applies geography&rsquo;s general concern with spatial variation to the special circumstances of the production, exchange, and consumption of goods and services. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Physical Environment- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many production patterns are rooted in its spatially variable circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Cultural Considerations- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">May condition economic or production decisions within the bounds of the environmentally possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Technological Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levels of technological development in a culture will affect its recognition of resources or its ability to exploit them. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Technology- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The totality of tools and methods available to and used by a culture group in producing items essential to its subsistence and comfort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Political Decisions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">May encourage or discourage-through subsidies, protective tariffs, or production restrictions-patterns of economic activity. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Economic Factors of demand- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately controls production, whether that demand is expressed through a free market mechanism, government instruction, or the consumption requirement of a single family producing for its own needs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>The Categories Of Economic Activity-</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-Primary Activities- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Those that harvest or extract something from the earth. At the beginning of the production cycle, where humans are in closest contact with the resources and potentialities of the environment. Such activities involve basic foodstuff and raw material production. Hunting and gathering, grazing, agriculture, fishing, forestry, and mining and quarrying are examples. </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Secondary Activities- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Those that add value to materials by changing their form or combining them into more useful--therefore more valuable--commodities. Copper smelting, steel making, metalworking, automobile production, textile and chemical industries are included in this phase of the production process. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Form Utility- <span style="font-weight: 400;">may range from simple handicraft production of pottery or woodenware to the delicate assembly of electronic goods or space vehicles. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Manufacturing and Processing industries, Energy (The Power Company), Construction industry- <span style="font-weight: 400;">included in this phase of the production process. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Tertiary Activities- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consist of those business and labor specializations that provide services to the primary and secondary sectors and goods and services to the general community and to the individual. These include financial, business, professional, clerical, and personal services. They constitute the vital link between producer and consumer, for tertiary occupations importantly include the wholesale and retail trade activities--including &ldquo;dot-com&rdquo; Internet sales--necessary in highly interdependent societies. Tertiary activities also provide essential information to manufacturers: the knowledge of market demand without which economically justifiable production decisions are impossible. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Quaternary Activities- <span style="font-weight: 400;">deal with information; Fourth class of economic activities. In economically advanced societies, a growing number of individuals and entire organizations are engaged in the processing and dissemination of information and in the administration and control of their own or other enterprises. This fourth class of economic activities, a subset of service activities rendered by &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; professionals working in education, government, management, information processing, and research. Transportation and communication services cut across the general categories of economic activity, unite them and make possible the spatial interactions that all human enterprise requires. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Quinary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes used to recognize high-level decision-making roles in all types of large organizations, public or private. </span></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Industry- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its common meaning as a branch of manufacturing activity, the word industry is frequently employed as a substitute, identical in meaning to </span><strong>activity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as a designation of those categories of economic enterprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Systems vs Components- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a broader organizational understanding of the larger economy of which the individual worker or establishment is part of, we look to systems rather than components of economies. Un </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Three Major Types Of System- </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-Subsistence Economies- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods and services are created for the use of the producers and their kinship groups. Therefore, there is little exchange of good and only limited need for markets.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Market (Commercial) Economies- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Have become dominant in nearly all parts of the world, producers or their agents in theory, freely market their goods and services, the laws of supply and demand determine price and quantity, and market competition is the primary force shaping production decisions and distributions. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Planned Economies- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Extreme form associated with the communist-controlled societies that have now collapsed in nearly every country where they were formerly created or imposed. Producers or their agents disposed of goods and services through government agencies that controlled both supply and price. The quantities produced and the locational patterns of production were strictly programmed by central planning departments. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Hunting &amp; Gathering- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before farming, they were the universal forms of primary production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing of crops and the tending of livestock. Whether for the subsistence of the producers or for sale or exchange, has replaced hunting and gathering as economically the most significant of the primary activities. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Classification Of Agricultural Societies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the twin bases of the importance of off-farm sales and the level of mechanization and technological advancement. Subsistence, traditional (or intermediate), and advanced are usual terms employed to recognize both aspects. These are not mutually exclusive but rather are recognized stages along a continuum of farm economy variants. At one end lies proudction solely for family sustenance, using rudimentary tools and native plants. At the other is the specialized, highly capitalized, near-industrialized agriculture for off-farm delivery to make advanced economies. Between these extremes is the middle ground of traditional agriculture, where farm production is in part destined for home consumption and in part oriented toward off-farm sale, either locally or in national and international markets. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Subsistence Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involves nearly total self-sufficiency on the part of its members. Production for exchange is minimal and any exchange is noncommercial; each family or close-knit social group relies on itself for its food and other most essential requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The essential contrast between extensive and intensive agriculture is realizable yield per unit of area used and, therefore, population supporting potential</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extensive Subsistence Agriculture- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Involves large areas of land and minimal labor input per hectare. Both production per land unit and population densities are low. </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Nomadic Herding- <span style="font-weight: 400;">The wandering but controlled movement of livestock solely dependent on natural forage, is the most extensive type of land use system. That is, it requires the greatest amount of land area per person sustained. Nomadic movement is tied to sparse and seasonal rainfall or to cold temperature regimes and to the areally varying appearance and exhaustion of forage. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Transhumance- <span style="font-weight: 400;">A special form of seasonal movement of livestock to exploit specific locally varying pasture conditions. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Shifting Cultivation- <span style="font-weight: 400;">A kind of nomadic farming. Through clearing and use, the soils of those areas lose many of their nutrients (as soil chemicals are dissolved and removed by surface and groundwater-leaching-or nutrients are removed from the land in the vegetables picked and eaten), and farms cultivating them need to move on after harvesting several crops. Also called swidden (an English localism for burned clearing), slash-and-burn, milpa, chitemene, and ladang. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Boserup Thesis- <span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed by the economist Ester Boserup, is based on the observation that population increases necessitate increased inputs of labor and technology to compensate for reductions in the natural yields of swidden farming. Holds that population growth forces an increased use of technology in farming, and, in a reversal of the Malthusian idea, that the supply of essential foodstuffs is fixed or only slowly expandable-triggers the switch from extensive to intensive subsistence agriculture, which sharply increases food production. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-Intensive Subsistence Agriculture- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Involves the cultivation of small landholdings through the expenditure of great amounts of labor per acre. Yields per unit area and population densities are both high. About 45% of the world is engaged in it; no longer fully applicable to a changing way of life and economy in which the distinction between subsistence and commercial is decreasingly valid. Although families may still be fed primarily with the produce of their individual plots, the exchange of farm commodities within the system is considerable. Nevertheless, hundreds of millions still remain small plot; most live in monsoon Asia. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Polyculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Production of several different crops, often in the same field. </span></li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-Urban Subsistence Farming- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of the world&rsquo;s subsistence farming is based in rural areas. Urban agriculture is a rapidly growing activity, with some 800 million city farmers worldwide providing (UN figures), one-seventh of the world&rsquo;s total food production. Occurs everywhere, whether developed or not; most prevalent in Asia. </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- 2 paths to promoting increased food production: 1) expand the land area under cultivation and 2) increase crop yields from existing farmlands</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Green Revolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorthand reference to a complex of seed and management innovations adapted to the needs of intensive agriculture and designed to bring larger harvests from a given area of farmland.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Commercial Agriculture- </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Agriculture within modern, developed economies is characterized by </span><strong>specialization</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">-by enterprise (farm), by area, and even by country; by </span><strong>off-farm sale</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than subsistence production; and by </span><strong>interdependence</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of producers and buyers linked through markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Agribusiness</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- applied to the growing merging of the older, farm centered crop economy and new patterns of more integrated production and marketing systems</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Von Thunen Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in the 19th century, Johann Heinrich von Thunen observed that lands of apparently identical physical properties were utilized for different agricultural purposes. Around each major urban market center, he noted, there developed a set of concentric land use rings of different farm products. The ring closest to the market specialized in perishable commodities that were both expensive to ship and in high demand. The high prices they could command in the urban market made their production an appropriate use of high-valued land near the city. Surrounding rings of farmlands farther away from the city were used for less perishable commodities with lower transport costs, reduced demand, and lower market prices. General farming and grain farming replaced the market gardening of the inner ring. At the outer margins of profitable agriculture, farthest from the single central market, livestock grazing and similar extensive land uses were found. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To explain why this should be so, von Thunen constructed a formal spatial model-perhaps the first developed to analyze human activity patterns. He concluded that the uses to which parcels were put was a function of the differing rent values placed on seemingly identical lands. Those differences reflected the cost of overcoming the distance separating a given farm from a central market town. The greater the distance, the higher was the operating cost to the farmer, since transport charges had to be added to other expenses. A simple exchange relationship ensued: the greater the transportation costs, the lower the rent that could be paid for land if the crop produced was to remain competitive in the market</span></p>
<p><strong>-Transport Gradient- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transport costs are the only variable, the relationship between land rent and distance from market can be easily calculated by reference to each competing crop&rsquo;s transport gradient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Von Thunen Rings- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basis of von Thunen&rsquo;s model- concentric zonal pattern of land use</span></p>
<p><strong>- Intensive commercial agriculture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- understood to refer specifically to the production of crops that give high yields and high market value </span></p>
<p><strong>-Truck Farms- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(and dairy farms) Horticultural or market garden farms that produce a wide range of vegetables and fruits; are found near most medium sized and large cities. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Livestock-Grain Farming- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">involves the growing of grain to be fed on the producing farm to livestock, which constitute the farm&rsquo;s cash product </span></p>
<p><strong>-Extensive Commercial Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farther from the market, on less expensive land, there is less need to use the land intensively. Cheaper land gives rise to larger farm units. Is typified by large wheat farms and livestock ranching. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Large Scale Wheat Farming- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requires sizable capital inputs for planting and harvesting machinery; faces competition from commercial and subsistence producers throughout the world</span></p>
<p><strong>-Livestock Ranching- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differs significantly from livestock-grain farming, and by its commercial orientation and distribution, from the nomadism it superficially resembles. A product of the 19th century growth of urban markets for beef and wool in Western Europe and the northeastern US, ranching has been primarily confined to areas of European settlement. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Mediterranean Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the arable land in the Mediterranean basin itself is planted to &nbsp;grains, and much of the agricultural area is used for grazing. However, this type of agriculture as a specialized farming economy, is known for grapes, olives, oranges, figs, vegetables, and similar commodities. They need warm temperatures all year round and a great deal of sunshine in the summer. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Plantation/Plantation Crops- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introduction of a foreign element-investment, management, and marketing-into an indigenous culture and economy, often employing an introduced alien labor force. The plantation itself is an estate whose resident workers produce one or two specialized crops. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Primary Economic Activities- </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These industries involve the direct exploitation of natural resources that are unequally available in the environment and differentially evaluated by different societies; their development, therefore, depends on the occurrence of perceived resources, the technology to exploit their natural availability, and the cultural awareness of their value</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-Gathering Industries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fishing, forestry, and fur trapping are gathering industries based on harvesting the natural bounty of renewable resources that are in serious danger of depletion through overexploitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Extractive Industries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mining and quarrying are examples, removing nonrenewable metallic and nonmetallic minerals, including the mineral fuels from the earth&rsquo;s crust. They are the initial raw material phase of modern industrial economies. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Resources/Natural Resources- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The naturally occurring materials that a human population, at any given state of economic development and technological awareness, perceives to be necessary and useful to its economic and material well-being. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Renewable Resources- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials that can be consumed and the replenished relatively quickly by natural or by human-assisted processes. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Maximum Sustainable Yield- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of a resource is the maximum volume or rate of use that will not impair its ability to be renewed or to maintain the same future productivity.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Nonrenewable Resources- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exist in finite amounts and either are not replaced by natural processes-at least not within any time frame of interest to the exploiting society-or are replaced at a rate slower than the rate of use. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Fishing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pressures on the world&rsquo;s fish stock expanded so rapidly that evidence is unmistakable that at least locally, their maximum sustainable yield is actually or potentially being exceeded. The annual fish supply comes from three sources:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inland catch, from ponds, lakes, and rivers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fish farming, in which fish are produced in a controlled and contained environment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marine catch, all wild fish harvested in coastal waters or on the high seas. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>-Continental Shelf- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gently sloping extension of submerged land bordering most coastlines and reaching seaward for varying distances up to 150 kilometers (about 100 miles) or more. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Banks- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensive elevated portions of the shelf where environmental conditions are most favorable for fish production. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Overfishing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catches above reproduction rate. In recent years, the productivity of marine fisheries has declined and pollution of coastal waters have seriously endangered the supplies of traditional and desirable food species. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tragedy Of The Commons- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economic reality that when a resource is available to all, each user, in the absence of collective controls, thinks he or she is best served by exploiting the resource to the maximum even though this exploitation means it eventual depletion. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Aquaculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fish farming; the breeding of fish in freshwater ponds, lakes, and canals or in fenced-off coastal bays and estuaries or enclosures. Provided about 30% of the total fish harvest in recent years. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Commercial Forests- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restricted to two very large global belts. One, nearly continuous, is found in upper-middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere; the second is located in the equatorial zones of South and Central America, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Northern Coniferous Or Softwood Forest- Lumber</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Tropical Lowland Hardwood Forests- Exploited primarily for fuelwood and charcoal</span></p>
<p><strong>-Roundwood-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Term for a log. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Metallic Minerals- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production of most, such as copper, lead, and iron ore, is affected by the balance of three forces: the quantity available, the richness of the ore, and the distance to markets. A fourth factor, land acquisition and royalty costs, may equal or exceed other considerations in mine development decisions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Beneficiation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste material removal. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nonmetallic Minerals- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the standpoint of volume and weight of material removed, the extraction of nonmetallic earth materials is the most important branch of the extractive industries. The minerals mined are usually classified by their end use. Of widest distribution, greatest use, and least long-distance movement are those used for </span><strong>construction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The mined fertilizer minerals include potash and phosphate, which do move in international trade because of their unequal distribution and market value. </span><strong>Precious and semiprecious </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">stones are able important in the trade of some countries, including South Africa and Sri Lanka. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Mineral Fuels- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern economic advancement has been heavily dependent on the </span><strong>mineral fuels:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Also known as</span><strong> fossil fuels,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these nonrenewable energy sources represent the capture of the sun&rsquo;s energy by plants and animals in earlier geologic time and its storage in the form of hydrocarbon compounds in sedimentary rocks within the earth&rsquo;s crust. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Coal- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the earliest in importance and is still the most plentiful of the mineral fuels. Not a resource of constant quality, varying in rank and grade: </span></p>
<p><strong>-Rank- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A measure from lignite to anthracite of increasing carbon contentment and fuel quality. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Grade- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A measure of its waste material content, particularly ash and sulfur. </span></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Petroleum- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">First extracted commercially in the 1860s in both the US and Azerbaijan, became a major power source and a primary component of the extractive industries only in the 20th century. </span></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Natural Gas- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been called the nearly perfect energy resource. Has a highly efficient, versatile fuel that requires little processing and its emissions do not contribute to urban air pollution or acid precipitation, although they do contain carbon dioxide. Estimated to last to near the last third of the century at 2007 levels of consumption</span></p>
<p><strong>- Ultimately recoverable reserves</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- those that may be found and recovered at much higher prices- might last another 200 years</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-9">Chapter 9: Livelihood And Economy: From Blue Collar to Gold Collar</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coming week we are exploring the guidelines or principles that help a business owner determine where to locate his or her new factory! &nbsp;We will also learn about manufacturing trends in other world nations and see how globalization affects this industry - and you- the consumer!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Fellman Chapter 9 &ldquo;Livelihood and Economy: From Blue Collar to Gold Collar.&rdquo; Why do factories favor one city over another- one site over the next one? Why are all the top software companies found in one small area of California? Learn what principles guide manufacturing locational decisions, the functional and locational characteristics of economic activities, and world manufacturing patterns and trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufacturing jobs have long been considered the secret to economic growth and prosperity. Communities possess certain resources and assets that attract different industries. Until recently, the steel industry was centered in the Northeast U.S. and in certain cities - Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, etc. &nbsp;Akron was Rubber capital of the world. &nbsp;Detroit was Motor City because of its corner on the automotive industry. &nbsp;Today these cities are part of the infamous Rust Belt. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;What happened? &nbsp;As loss of manufacturing jobs impacts these cities and regions, what changes are occurring? &nbsp;What world regions are also going through similar cycles of growth and change and how are they coping?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms "</span><strong>blue collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" and "white </span><strong>collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" are occupational classifications that distinguish workers who perform manual labor from workers who perform professional jobs.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Blue Collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- requires manual labor; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a blue-collar worker is a working class person who performs non-agricultural manual labour. Blue-collar work may involve skilled or unskilled manufacturing, mining, sanitation, custodial work, oil field work, construction, mechanical maintenance, warehousing, firefighting, technical installation and many other types of physical work. Often something is physically being built or maintained; involved in trade occupations; working-class people who perform skilled or unskilled manual labor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>White Collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the white-collar worker typically performs work in an office environment and may involve sitting at a computer or desk; perform professional, managerial, or administrative work in an office environment; a person who performs professional, managerial, or administrative work. White-collar work is performed in an office, cubicle, or other administrative setting; White-collar work is performed in an office, cubicle, or other administrative setting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Pink Collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third type of work is a service worker (pink collar) whose labour is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales or other service-oriented work; a pink-collar worker performs jobs in the service industry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Gold Collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Gold-collar worker (GCW) is a </span><strong>neologism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a newly coined word or expression)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has been used to describe either young, low-wage workers who invest in conspicuous luxury, or highly skilled knowledge workers, traditionally classified as white </span><strong>collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but who have recently become essential enough to business operations as to warrant a new classification</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Economically Rational- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the information at their disposal, they make locational, production, or purchasing decisions in light of a perception of what is most cost-effective and advantageous. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Maximizing Profit- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the standpoint of producers or sellers of goods or services, it is assumed each is intent of maximizing profit. To reach that objective, each may consider a host of production and marketing costs and political, competitive, and other limiting factors-and perhaps, respond to individual behavioral quirks-but the ultimate goal of profit-seeking remains clear. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Market Mechanism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measured by </span><strong>price-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the price of land (rent), of labor (wages), of a college course (tuition)&lt; or of goods sat the store. In turn, price is seen as a function of </span><strong>supply </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><strong>demand.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In large, complex economies where there are many producers, sellers, and buyers, and many alternative products competing in the marketplace, price is the neutral measure of comparative value and profitability. The theoretical relationship between supply, demand, and price is simple. If demand for a good or services exceeds its available supply, scarcity will drive up the price it can command in the marketplace. That increased price will enhance the profitability of the sale, which will encourage existing producers to increase output or induce new producers and sellers to enter the market. That is, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">the higher the price of a good, the more of it will be offered in the market. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the price is very high, however, relatively few people are inclined to buy. To dispose of their increased output, old and new producers of the commodity are forced to reduce prices to enlarge the market by making the good affordable to a larger number of potential customers. That is, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">at lower prices, more of a good will be purchased. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the price falls too low, production or sale becomes unprofitable and inefficient suppliers are forced out of business, reducing supply. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Market Equilibrium- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marked by the price at which supply equals demand, satisfying the needs of consumers and the profit motivation of suppliers. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Secondary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involve transforming raw materials into usable products. Dominant among them is manufacturing in all of its aspects. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Principles (Ground Rules) Of Location- </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain input costs of manufacturing are </span><strong>spatially fixed costs, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is, are relatively unaffected in their amount or relative importance no matter where the industry is located within a generalized regional or national setting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other input costs of manufacturing are </span><strong>spatially variable costs; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is, they show significant differences from place to place in both their amount and their relative contribution to the total costs of manufacturing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate aim of the economic activity is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">profit maximization. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">In anj economic environment of full and perfect competition, the profit objective is most likely to be achieved if the manufacturing enterprise is situated at the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">least total cost </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">location. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since among the totality of production costs some inputs are approximately the same irrespective of location, fixed costs are not of major importance in determining optimum, or least cost locations. Rather, the industrialist bases the locational search on the minimization of variable costs. The locational determinant is apt to be the cost that is an important component of total costs and shows the greatest spatial variation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation charges-the costs of accumulating inputs and of distributing products-are highly variable costs. As such, they (rather than the commodity transported) may become the locational determinant, imparting an unmistakable </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">orientation-</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a term describing locational tendencies- to the plant siting decision. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual establishments rarely stand alone; they are part of integrated manufacturing sequences and environment in which </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">interdependence </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">increases as the complexity of industrial processes increases. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linkages </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">between firms may localize manufacturing in areas of industrial agglomeration where common resources or multiple suppliers of product inputs are found. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Spatially Fixed (Basic) Costs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Represent the minimum price that must be paid at any location for the necessary inputs of production of a given item. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spatially Variable (Locational) Costs-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The additional costs incurred at alternate locations in overcome distance, attracting labor, purchasing the plant site, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Raw Market Orientation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different but comparable examples are fruit and vegetable canning in California, midwestern meat packing, and Florida orange juice concentration and freezing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Labor Flexibility- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increasingly important consideration for many manufacturers today, implying more highly educated workers able to apply themselves to a wide variety of tasks and functions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Market Orientation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the transportation charges for sending finished goods to market are a relatively high proportion of the total value of the good (or can be significantly reduced by proximity to market), then the attraction of location near to the consumer is obvious and market orientation results. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ubiquitous Industries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain producers that are, in fact, inseparable from the immediate markets they serve and are widely distributed. Newspaper publishing, bakeries, and dairies, all of which produce a highly perishable commodity designed for immediate consumption, are examples. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Weight Reduction/Gaining- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copper smelting or iron ore beneficiation- described earlier as examples of raw material orientation- may also be seen as industries engaged in weight reduction designed to minimize transportation costs by removal of waste material prior to shipment. Some market orientation is of the opposite nature, reflecting weight-gaining production. Soft drink bottlers is an example. </span></p>
<p><strong>Water Transportation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cheapest means of long-distance freight movement, with low operating and right of way costs. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Railroads- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiently move large volumes of freight over long distances at low fuel and labor costs. They are,however, inflexible in route, slow to respond to changing industrial locational patterns, and expensive to construct and maintain. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Motor Trucks- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">high volume, high speed motor trucks operating on modern roadway and expressway systems have altered the competitive picture to favor highways over railways in many intercity movements in modern economies. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Multimodal Freight- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, hauling a truck trailer on a railroad flatcar (piggybacking) or on ship deck serves to minimize total freight rates and transport times. Such movements seek the advantages of the most efficient carrier for each stage of the journey from cargo origin point to final destination through the use of internationally standardized shipping containers, which are tracked by computer. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Pipelines- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide efficient, speedy, and dependable transportation specifically suited to the movement of a variety of liquids and gases. Serve to localize along their routes the industries that use the transported commodity as raw material.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Air Transport- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to pipelines, has little locational significance for most industries despite its growing importance in long-distance passenger and high-value package freight movement. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Freight Rates- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charges made for loading, transporting, and unloading of goods. Are said to discriminate between commodities on the basis of their assumed ability to bear transport costs in relation to their value. Variable transportation costs of represent the application of differing freight rates. </span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>-Fixed Costs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these forms of rate discrimination, each shipment of whatever nature must bear a share of the fixed costs of the company&rsquo;s investment in land, plant, and equipment and the assigned </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">terminal </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">line-haul </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">costs of the shipment. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Terminal Costs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charges associated with loading, packing, and unloading of a shipment and of the paperwork and shipping documents it entails. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Line-Haul (Over-The-Road) Costs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vary with the individual shipments and are the expenses involved in the actual movement of commodities once they have been loaded. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tapering Principle- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of when carrier costs have a tendency to decline as the length of haul increases because scale economies in long-haul movement permit the averaging of total costs over a greater number of miles. The actual costs of transport, including terminal charges and line costs, increase at a decreasing rate as fixed costs are spread over longer hauls. The tapering of company cost is differently expressed among media because their mixes of fixed and variable costs are different. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Break-Of-Bulk Points-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sites where goods have to be transferred or transshipped from one carrier to another. </span></p>
<p><strong>-In-Transit Privilege- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a traffic-generating inducement, may be granted to a manufacturer by a transportation agency through the quotation of a special single rate from material source to market for a movement that may be interrupted for processing or manufacturing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">en route. </span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Industrial Location Theories- </strong></p>
<p><strong>-Least-Cost Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the work of Alfred Weber (1868-1958) and sometimes called </span><strong>Weberian analysis. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It explains the optimum location of a manufacturing establishment based on minimizing three basic expenses: relative transport costs, labor costs, and </span><strong>agglomeration </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(the clustering of productive activities and people for mutual advantage) costs. Weber concluded that transport costs are the major consideration determining location. He made five controlling assumptions: (1) An area is completely uniform physically, politically, culturally, and technologically. Known as the </span><strong>uniform, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or </span><strong>isotropic, plain </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">assumption. (2) Manufacturing involves a single product to be shipped to a single market whose location is known. (3) Inputs involve raw materials from more than one known source location. (4) Labor is infinitely available but immobile in location. (5) Transportation routes are not fixed but connect origin and destination by the shortest path; and transport costs directly reflect the weight of items shipped and the distance they are moved. Given these assumptions, Weber derived the least transport cost location by means of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">locational triangle. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It diagrams the cost consequences of fixed locations of materials and market and of movement in any direction of a given weight of commodity at a uniform cost per unit of distance. The problem is to locate the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimum point of production </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">where the total ton-distance involved in assembling materials and distributing the product is at a minimum. Each corner of the triangle exerts its pull; each has a defined cost of production should it be chosen as the plant site. Weberian analysis aims at the least transport cost location, which most likely will be an intermediate point somewhere within the locational triangle. Its exact position will depend on distances, the respective weights of the raw material inputs, and the final weight of the finished product, and may be either material (reflecting a sizable weight loss during the production process) or market (indicating a weight gain) oriented. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Locational Interdependence Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exists when the locational decision of one firm is influenced by locations chosen by its competitors. It influences the manner in which competitive firms with identical cost structures arrange themselves in space to assure themselves a measure of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">spatial monopoly </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">in their &nbsp;combined market. In locational interdependence theory, the concern is with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">variable revenue analysis </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">rather than, as in the Weber model, with variable costs. The simplest case concerns the locational decisions of two firms in competition with each other to supply identical goods to customers evenly spaced along a linear market. The usual example is of two ice cream vendors, each selling the same brand at the same price along a stretch of beach having a uniform distribution of people. All will purchase the same amount of ice cream (that is, demand is </span><strong>inelastic- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is not sensitive to a change in the price) and will patronize the seller nearer to them. Suggestion is that the two sellers would eventually cluster in the mid-point of the linear market so that each vendor could supply customers at the extremities of the market without yielding locational advantage to the single competitor. This is a spatial solution that maximizes return but does not minimize costs. The lowest total cost location for each of the two vendors would be at the midpoint of his or her half of the beach. To maximize market share, however, one seller might decide to relocate immediately next to the competitor, dominating now three-fourths of the entire market. The logical retaliation would be for the second seller to jump back over the first to recapture market share. Ultimately, side by side location at the centerline of the beach is inevitable and a stable placement is achieved since neither seller can gain any further advantage from moving. The economist Harold Hotelling (1895-1973), who is usually associated with the locational interdependence approach, expanded the conclusion about clustered ice cream sellers to a more generalized statement explaining industrial concentration by multiple producers under conditions of identical production costs and inelastic market demand. However, if the market becomes sensitive to price, sales to more distance customers will be discouraged and producers seeking to maximize sales will again separate rather than aggregate. The conclusion then is that price sensitivity (elasticity of demand) will encourage industrial dispersion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Profit-Maximization Approaches- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many theorists, the simplicities and rigidities of the least-cost and the locational interdependence explanations are unrealistically restrictive. Ultimately, they maintain, the correct location of fa production facility is where the net profit is greatest. They propose employing a </span><strong>substitution principle </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">that recognizes that in many industrial processes it is possible to replace a declining amount of one input with an increase in another, or to increase transportation costs while simultaneously reducing land rent. With substitution, a number of different points may be appropriate manufacturing locations. Further, they suggest, a whole series of points may exist where total revenue of an enterprise just equals its total cost of producing a given output. These points, connected, mark the </span><strong>spatial margin of profitability </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and define the larger area within which profitable operation is possible. Location anywhere within the margin assures some profit and tolerates both imperfect knowledge and personal (rather than economic) considerations. Such less-than-optimal, but still acceptable, sites are considered </span><strong>satisficing locations. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some firm, spatial margins may be very broad because transport costs area negligible factor in production and marketing. Such firms are said to be </span><strong>footloose, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is, neither resource nor market oriented. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Fordism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembly line production of identical commodities by a rigidly controlled and specialized labor force for generalized mass markets-known as Fordism to recognize Henry Ford&rsquo;s pioneering development of the system-became less realistic in both market and technology terms. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Flexible Manufacturing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processes based on smaller production runs of a greater variety of goods aimed at smaller, niche markets than were catered to by traditional manufacturing have become common. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Agglomeration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spatial concentration of people and activities for mutual benefit. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Agglomeration (External) Economies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits for individual firms that they could not experience in isolation. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Infrastructure- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shared transport facilities, social services, communication facilities, public utilities, and other installations and services needed to facilitate industrial and other forms of economic development. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Multiplier Effect- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causes each new firm added to the agglomeration to lead to the further development of infrastructure and linkages. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Deglomeration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A disadvantage of agglomeration. When the costs of aggregation exceed the benefits, a firm will actually profit by relocating to a more isolated position. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Just-In-Time (JIT) Manufacturing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to deglomeration, seeks to reduce inventories for the production process by purchasing inputs for arrival just in time to use and producing output just in time to sell. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Flexible Production Systems- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">JIT is one expression of a transition from mass-production Fordism to more flexible production systems. That flexibility is designed to allow producers to shift quickly and easily between different levels of output and important to move from one factory process or product to another as market demand dictates. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Comparative Advantage- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tells us that areas and countries can best improve their economies and living standards through specialization and trade. These benefits will follow if each area or country concentrates on the production of those items for which it has the greatest relative advantage over other areas ofr for which it has the least relative disadvantage and imports all other goods. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Outsourcing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producing parts or products abroad for domestic sale. Has also come to mean subcontracting production and service sector work to outside, often nonunion, domestic companies. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Offshoring- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The practice of either hiring foreign workers or, commonly, contracting with a foreign third-party service provider to take over and run particular business processes or operations, such as call centers or accounting, billing, and similar nonproduction &ldquo;back office&rdquo; aspects of manufacturing. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Hypercompetition- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional notions of comparative advantage are disappearing in the face of a new era of hypercompetition, at least in business and professional services. </span></p>
<p><strong>-New International Division Of Labor (NIDL)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exploitation of comparative advantage and utilization of outsourcing and offshoring, by transferring technology from economically advanced to underdeveloped economies is transforming the world economy by introducing NIDL. Builds on the current trend toward the increased subdivision of manufacturing processing into smaller steps (and a similar fragmentation of stages of professional services). </span></p>
<p><strong>-Transnational Corporations (TNCs)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">private firms that have established branch operations in nations foreign to their headquarters&rsquo; country. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the purchase or construction of factories and other fixed assets by TNCs- has been a significant engine of globalization. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Export Processing Zones (EPCs)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concentrates much of new plant investment and expanded developing country industrial production. Recently created within those countries. May be either a delimited geographical area or, frequently, an export-oriented manufacturing enterprise located anywhere within a host country that benefits from special investment incentives. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Megalopolis/Conurbation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extended urbanized area formed by the gradual merger of several individual cities. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gross Value Added (GVA)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linked to GDP; the link can get defined as GVA + taxes on products - subsidies on products = GDP. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Primary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather, extract, or grow things.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Secondary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give form utility to the products of primary industry through manufacturing and processing efforts. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tertiary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major and growing segment of both domestic and international economic activity that involves services rather than the production of commodities. Consist of business and labor specializations that provide services to the primary and secondary sectors, to the general community, and to the individual. They imply pursuits other than the actual production of tangible commodities. Tertiary services fulfill the exchange function of advanced economies and provide the market transactions necessary in highly interdependent societies. In commercial activities, they also provide vitally needed information about market demand, without which economically justifiable production decisions are impossible. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Effective Demand- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supply of low-level services of necessity must be identical to the spatial distribution of effective demand, that is, wants made meaningful through purchasing power. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tourism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel undertaken for purposes of recreation rather than business. Has become not only the most important single tertiary sector activity but is, as well, the world&rsquo;s largest industry in jobs and total value generated. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Quaternary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">May be seen realistically as an advanced form of services involving specialized knowledge, technical skills, communication ability, or administrative competence. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Quinary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gold collar professions of the chapter title, another separately recognized subdivision of the tertiary sector representing the special and highly paid skills of top business executives, government officials, and the like. These people find their place of business in major metropolitan centers, in and near major universities and research parks, at first-rank medical centers, and in cabinet and department-level offices of political capitals. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Postindustrial- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The essence of the transition steadily away from production and processing and toward the trade, personal, and professional services of the tertiary sector and the information and control activities of the quaternary and quinary. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-10">Chapter 10: Patterns Of Development And Change</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 10 &ldquo;Reading the Urban Landscape: Census Data and Field Observation&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; We will study the concentric ring model, the sector model, and the multiple nuclei model as we learn about the many changes that have occurred in the American city.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 10 &ldquo;Patterns of Development and Change&rdquo; in the Fellmann textbook. Learn about development and underdevelopment and what the economic models of development are and how they are measured. What are women&rsquo;s roles in development?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>- Development-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the extent to which the human and natural resources of an area or country have been brought into full productive use</span></p>
<p><strong>- Underdevelopment-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the possibility or desirability of applying additional capital, labor, or technology to the resource base of an area to permit the present population to improve its material well being or to allow populations to increase without a deterioration in their quality of life</span></p>
<p><strong>- Core periphery model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">based on the observation that within many spatial systems sharp territorial contrasts exist in wealth, economic advancement, and growth- in development- between economic heartlands and outlying subordinate zones</span></p>
<p><strong>- Circular and cumulative causation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth in the developing core must come at the expense of the peripheries of the country; this continues to polarize development and leads to a permanent division between prosperous (dominating) cores and depressed (exploited) peripheral districts milked of surplus labor, raw materials, and profits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Trickle-down effects/Spread effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">income convergence will occur this way, working to diffuse benefits outward from the center in the form of higher prices paid for needed materials or through the dispersion of technology to branch plants or contract suppliers in lower-cost regions of production. Should work, on the international scale, to reduce the dominance of formerly exploitative cores and equalize incomes between world regions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gross domestic product (GDP)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">total market value of all final goods and services produced annually within the borders of a country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gross national income (GNI)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adds to GDP the total foreign income earned by its citizens (gross national income was formerly known by gross national product). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Purchasing power parity (PPP)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often applied to GNI to account for price differences. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Three adjustments to GNI to compare development-</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convert each country&rsquo;s currency into a single measure, typically U.S. dollar equivalents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide by the number of people in a country to get GNI per capita. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that market rates of currency exchange fluctuate with business cycles and trading patterns and do not necessarily correspond to prices in a particular country. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Informal Economy- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">shadow, gray, underground economy; In all countries, at least a portion of goods and services is produced and workers supported by informal economy. In developing countries as a group, the informal economy (2002) is equivalent to 41% of their official gross domestic product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gross global product- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the total value of goods and services produced by the world economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Technology- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the totality of tools and methods available to and used by a culture group in producing items essential to its subsistence and comfort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Technology gap- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A contrast in the range and productivity of artifacts introduced at the core and those known or employed at the periphery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Cultural convergence- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing similarity in technologies and ways of life among societies at the same levels of development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Technology transfer- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing in one&rsquo;s own territory and under one&rsquo;s own control the productive plants and processes marking the more advanced countries. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary economic measures commonly accepted as most revealing of the relative progress of countries of the South along the scale of development: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross national income and purchasing power parity per capita</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per capita energy consumption</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percent of the workforce engaged in agriculture</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calorie intake per capita /0p; </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Per capita energy consumption- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a common measure of technological advancement of nations because it loosely correlates with per capita income, degree of industrialization, and use of advanced technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Landlessness- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a function of an imbalance between the size of the agricultural labor force and the arable land resource. Frequently a reflection of concentration of ownership by a few and consequent landlessness for many. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Rostow Five Successive Stages of Growth and Advancement- </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional societies: poorly developed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preconditions for takeoff established. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takeoff: critical developmental stage, lasting perhaps 20-30 years, during which rates of investment increase, new industries are established, resources are exploited, and growth becomes the expected norm. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive to maturity: sees the application of modern technology to all phases of economic activity; diversification carries the economy beyond the industrial emphases first triggering growth, and the economy becomes increasingly self-sufficient. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age of mass consumption.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postindustrial. A more recent stage that refers to most advanced economies. Services replace industry as the principal sector of the economy, professional and technical skills assume preeminence in the labor force, and information replaces energy as the key productive resource. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Deprivation vs. Achievement- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human development index (HDI) measures average achievement, but the Human Poverty Index (HPI) measures deprivation in the same three measures of development underlying the HDI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gender- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a cultural sense, refers to socially created, not biologically based, distinctions between femininity and masculinity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gender-Related Development Index (GDI)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a composite index that attempts to measure inequalities of achievements between men and women through differences in their life expectancies at birth, literacy levels and educational attainments, and female and male earned income shares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gender empowerment measure (GEM)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">devised by the United Nationals Development programme emphasizes female participation in national economic, political, and professional affairs. Heavily biased toward measures that technologically advanced, career-oriented, Western cultures consider indicative of gender equality and progress; they do not consider the standards and values accepted in other cultural settings. Their studies show that gender equality in political, economic, and professional activities is not necessarily related to level of national wealthy or development. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-11">Chapter 11: Urban Systems And Urban Structures</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of my very favorite parts of AP Human Geography - cities! &nbsp;Urban concepts are heavily tested in the AP Human Geography exam so pay close attention to the following weeks of new information on cities! &nbsp;First we will talk about the origins of the concept of "city"! &nbsp;Then, we will learn about the role they play in today's world both locally and on an international scale. &nbsp;Europeans cities and non-Western cities are examined and we look at the ways space is organized within a city. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 11 &ldquo;Urban Systems and Urban Structures&rdquo; in Fellmann textbook. We will learn about the nature of cities &ndash; origins, definitions, and locations &ndash; in the world. Also, we will cover the economic base and systems of cities: functions, hierarchies, and networks. Urban land use, social areas, and patterns of change in urban areas will be discussed. World urban diversity &ndash; Western and non-Western cities will be compared and contrasted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Megacities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metropolises with populations of 10 million or more. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Conurbations- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensive metropolitan regions created when separate major metropolitan complexes of whatever size expand along the superior transportation facilities connecting them, meet, and bind together at their outer margins. Where this increasingly common pattern has emerged, the urban landscape can no longer be described in simple terms. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Megalopolis- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original and largest megalopolis that contains the economic, political, and administrative core of the US: the nearly continuous urban string that stretches from north of Boston to south of Washington D.C.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Cities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the oldest markets of civilization. &nbsp;Though flawed, remain the capstone of our cultures, the organizing focuses of modern societies and economies, and the magnet of people everywhere. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Hinterland- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The productive area surrounding a population center. Cities depended on having close reciprocal relationships with these. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tell- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An occupation mound. </span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>-The Nature Of Cities</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- All cities show regularities appropriate to their time and place of existence: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All perform functions-have an economic base-generating the income necessary to support themselves and their contained population. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">None exists in a vacuum; each is part of a larger society and economy with which it has essential reciprocal connections. Each is a unit in a system of cities and a focus for a surrounding non urban area. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has a more or less orderly internal arrangement of land uses, social groups, and economic functions. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Site- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact terrain features associated with the city, as well as-less usefully-to its absolute (Globe Grid) location. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Special Placement Circumstances- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include </span><strong>break-of-bulk </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">locations such as river crossing points where cargoes and people must interrupt a journey, </span><strong>head-of-navigation (bay head) </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">locations where the limits of water transportation are reached, and </span><strong>railhead </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">locations where a railroad ended. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Economic Base- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">From their ancient beginnings, cities depended on close reciprocal relationships with their hinterlands. They provided the market where rural produce could be exchanged for the goods produced and the defense or religious functions performed by the city. Such rural service functions remain important. However, not all of the activities carried on within a city are intended to &nbsp;connect that city with the outside world. Some are necessary simply to support the city itself. Together, these two levels of activity make up the economic base of an urban settlement. Understanding the growth or decline of cities hinges on grasping the relationship between the two sectors. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Basic Sector- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engagement either in the production of goods or the performance of services for areas and people outside the city itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nonbasic Sector- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producing goods or services for residents of the urban unit itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Multiplier Effect- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Means that a city&rsquo;s employment and population grow with the addition of non basic workers and dependents as a supplement to new basic employment. The size is determined by the community&rsquo;s basic/nonbasic ratio. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Transportation Centers- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spatial pattern of transportation centers is that of alignment. Routes of communication form the orienting axes along which cities developed and on which at least their initial functional success depended. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Special-Function Cities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those engaged in mining, manufacturing, or other activities the localization of which is related to raw material occurrence, agglomeration economies, or the circular and cumulative attractions of constantly growing market and labor concentrations. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Central Places- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodes for the distribution of economic goods and services to surrounding non urban populations. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Central Place Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by the geographer Walter Christaller. To explain those observed settlement size and spacing regularities. He observed a pattern of interdependent small, medium, and larger towns that together could provide the goods and services needed by a dispersed rural population. Small towns would serve as marketplaces for frequently required low order commodities and services, while expensive luxury goods would be available only in larger communities that were central to a number of surrounding small towns. People, that is, would have to travel only short distances for basic things, and longer distances for expensive and infrequently demanded goods and services. This explanation and description of the urban size and spacing regularities he observed have been shown to be generally applicable in widely differing regions of the world. When varying incomes, cultures, physical landscapes, and transportation systems are taken into consideration, his theory holds up rather well. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Urban Influence Zones- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The areas outside of a city that are still affected by it. </span></p>
<p><strong>-The Urban Hierarchy- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably the most effective way to recognize how systems of cities are organized. A ranking of cities based on their size and functional complexity. </span></p>
<p><strong>-World Cities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing at the top of national systems of cities are a relatively few agglomerations that may be called world cities. These large urban centers are control points for international production, marketing, and finance. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Rank-Size Rule- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summarizes the city size hierarchy in some countries, especially those with complex economies and a long urban history. It tells us that the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">th largest city of a national system of cities will be 1/</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">n </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">the size of the largest city. That is, the second largest settlement will be &frac12; the size of the largest, the 10th biggest will be 1/10 the size of the first ranked city. Although no national city system exactly meets the requirements of the rank-size rule, that of Russia and the US closely approximates it. Less applicable to countries with developing economies or where the city system is dominated by a primate city. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Primate City- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a city that is far more than twice the size of the second ranked city. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Network City- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years a new kind of urban spatial pattern has begun to appear, one seemingly divorced from the more recognized hierarchical orderings of cities we have reviewed. Evolves when two or more previously independent nearby cities, potentially complementary in functions, strive to cooperate by developing between them high-speed transportation corridors and communications infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Urban- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often used to describe such places as a town, city, suburb, and metropolitan area, but it is a general term, not used to specify a particular type r size of settlement. Not everyone uses terms designating the different types of urban settlement in the same way. </span></p>
<p><strong>-City/Town- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denote nucleated settlements, multifunctional in character, including an established central business district and both residential and nonresidential land uses. Towns are smaller in size and have less functional complexity than cities, but they still have a nuclear business concentration.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Suburb- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implies a subsidiary area, a functionally specialized segment of a larger urban complex. It may be dominantly or exclusively residential, industrial, or commercial, but by the specialization of its land uses and functions, a suburb is not self-sufficient. However, can be independent political entities. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Central City- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principal core of a larger urban area, separately incorporated and ringed by its dependent suburbs. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Urbanized Area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A continuously built-up landscape defined by building and population densities with no reference to political boundaries. May be viewed as the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">physical city </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and may contain a central city and many contiguous cities, towns, suburbs, and other urban tracts. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Metropolitan Area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrasting from urbanized area, refers to a large-scale </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">functional </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">entity, perhaps containing several urbanized areas, discontinuously built-up but nonetheless operating as an integrated economic whole. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Metropolitan Statistical Areas- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprised of a central county or counties with at least one urbanized area of at least 50,000 population, plus adjacent outlying counties with a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county as measured by commuting volumes. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Central Business District (CBD)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the older central city, the radiating mass transit lines focused on the original city center, giving that area the highest accessibility within the growing urban complex and, therefore, the greatest attraction for those functions profiting most from a central location. Building lots within the emerging CBD, as a result of their scarcity and accessibility, could command high rental and purchase prices. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Hot Corner- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peak intersection of mass transit convergence. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Concentric Zone Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by University of Chicago sociologists the explain the structuring of American cities in the 1920s. It describes the urban community as a set of nested rings of mostly residential diversity at increasing distances in all directions from the CBD fringe. The first, a zone of transition, is characterized by stagnation and deterioration and contains high-density, low-income slums, rooming houses, and perhaps ethnic ghettos. Next outward is a zone of workers&rsquo; homes, usually smaller older houses on small lots. The third zone houses better residences, single-family homes or higher-rent apartments for those able to exercise choice in housing location and afford the longer journey to CBD employment. Finally, just beginning to emerge when this model was proposed, was an outer zone of low-density suburban development. The concentric zone model is dynamic. Each type of land use and each residential group tends to move outward into the next outer zone as the city matures and expands. That movement was seen as part of a ceaseless process of invasion and succession that yielded a restructured land use pattern and population segregation by income level. The social patterning of Chicago shows some accordance with this model. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Sector Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devised in the 1930s by the land economist Homer Hoyt. Focuses on transportation arterials. It posits that high-rent residential areas are dominant in city expansion and grow outward from the city center along major transportation routes such as streetcar and elevated railroad lines or suburban commuter routes. As cities grow, the model suggests, the highest-income groups move into new homes in new neighborhoods located along the extending transit lines radiating outward from the center of the city. Middle-income housing follows and clusters around the residences of the wealthy, and low-income populations occupy districts adjacent to the areas of industry and associated transportation, such as freight railroad lines. The sector model is also dynamic, marked by a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">filtering down process </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">as older areas are abandoned by the outward movement of their original higher-income inhabitants, with the lowest-income populations (closest to the city center and furthest from the current location of the wealthy) becoming the inheritors of the least-desirable vacated area. The expansion of the city is radial. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Multiple-Nuclei Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrasts the sector model. Proposed by geographers Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman. In the view, large cities developed by peripheral spread from several nodes of growth, not just one. Certain activities have specific locational requirements: the retail district needs accessibility; a port function needs a waterfront site; heavy industry requires level land adjacent to railroads. Peripheral expansion of the separate nuclei eventually leads to coalescence and the meeting of incompatible land uses along the lines of juncture. The urban land use pattern, therefore, is not regularly structured from a single center in a sequence of circles of a series of sectors but based on separately expanding clusters of contrasting activities. Gives a better insight into metropolitan area structuring of the more recent past and present, but should be supplemented by newer visualizations of contemporary metropolitan complexes or galactic cities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Peripheral Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takes into account the major changes in urban form that have taken place since WWII, especially the suburbanization of various central city functions. The peripheral model focuses on the peripheral belt that lies within the metropolitan area, but outside the central city itself. Functions of peripheral belt communities are defined not by their relationship to the metropolitan center, but to other parts of the peripheral zone. In these models, circumferential highways and expressways outside the central city make large tracts of land available for development in the low-density sprawl characteristic of individual rather than mass transit movement of people. Residences are segregated by price level into relatively homogenous suburban clusters, and individual nodes in the peripheral belt are centers for employment or services. Much of the life of the residents of the periphery takes place outside the central city. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Social Status- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determined by income, education, occupation, and home value, though it may be measured differently in different cultures. Agrees with the sector model. Today, social status divisions are often perpetuated between separate municipalities, which may differ greatly in relative income. Many residential developments are also income-segregated because their houses are of similar value. To preserve the upscale nature of a development and protect land values, self-governing community associations may be formed to enact and enforce land use restrictions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Family Status- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the distance from the city center increases, the average age of the adult residents declines, or the sizes of their family increases, or both. Within a particular sector-say, that of high status-older people whose children do not live with them and young professionals without families tend to live close to the city center. In contrast, young families seeking space for child rearing locate farther from the city center, while singles and empty nesters may covet more the accessibility of the cultural and business life of the urban core. However, where inner-city life is unpleasant, there is a tendency for older people to migrate to the suburbs or to retirement communities. The arrangement that emerges is a concentric circle patterning according to family status. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnicity-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For some groups, ethnicity is a more important residential location determinant than is social or family status. Areas of homogeneous ethnic identification appear in the social geography of cities as separate clusters or nuclei, reminiscent of the multiple-nuclei concept of urban structure. For some ethnic groups, cultural segregation is both sought and vigorously defended, even in the face of pressures for neighborhood change exerted by potential competitors for housing space. Certain ethnic or racial groups have had segregation forced on them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Gated Community- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A subset of the master-planned community. A fenced or walled residential area with checkpoints staffed by security guards and access limited to designated individuals and identified guests. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Institutional Controls- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have strongly influenced the land use arrangements and growth patterns of most US cities over the past century. Indeed the governments of most Western urbanized societies have instituted myriad laws to control all aspects of urban life with particular emphasis on the ways in which individual property and city areas can be developed and used. These nonmarket controls on land use are designed to minimize incompatibilities, provide for the creation in appropriate locations of public uses, and private uses needed for and conducive to a balanced, orderly community. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Metropolitanization/Suburbanization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two most prominent patterns of population growth between 1950 and 1990. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Edge Cities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional and national headquarters of leading corporations, banking, professional services of all kinds, major hotel complexes and recreational centers-all formerly considered immovable keystones of central business districts-became part of the new outer cities. Sometimes called edge cities, they are defined by their large nodes of concentrated office and commercial structures and characterized by having more jobs than residents within their boundaries. Now exist in all regions of urbanized Anglo America. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Brownfield Sites- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once vibrant industrial districts that have been left behind as blighted, polluted sites. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gentrification- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another part of central city residential revival is found in gentrification, the rehabilitation of housing tin the oldest and now deteriorated inner-city areas by middle and high-income groups. Welcomed by many as a positive, privately financed force in the renewal of depressed urban neighborhoods, gentrification also has serious negative social and housing impacts on the low-income, frequently minority families that are displaced. Another expression of the continuous remarking of urban land use and social patterns in accordance with the rent-paying abilities of alternate potential occupants. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Inverse Concentric Zone- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pattern in which the elite and upper class reside in central areas and the social status declines with increasing distance from the center. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Latin American City Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the center is the traditional market area, key government and religious buildings, and a modern central business district. Extending outward from the center is a commercial spine that features high status establishments and terminates at a suburban mall. Squatter settlements are found at the urban periphery and in disamenity zones such as near dumps, in flood-prone areas, or on slopes too steep for conventional development. </span></p>

<p><strong>10 Traits Associated With Sprawl (identified by well-known policy analyst Anthony Downs)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlimited outward extension</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-density development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leapfrog development miles beyond the urban fringe</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fragmentation of political powers among many small municipalities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominance of transportation by private automobiles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of centralized planning or control of land uses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial strip development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great fiscal disparities among towns and neighborhoods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segregation of types of land uses in different zones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliance on a trickle-down process to provide low-income housing </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Metropolitan Government (trait #6)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A regional governmental agency created to coordinate a variety of areawide functions such as water supply, transportation, open space, and waste management on behalf of the independent cities within the region. It is a response to the political fragmentation of the urban area. </span></p>
<p><strong>Zoning- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">City planners traditionally use zoning to separate incompatible land uses, such as housing and chemical factories. Planning regulations that define permissible land uses for parcels of the city. </span></p>
<p><strong>Congestion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of roads, causing travel delays. </span></p>
<p><strong>Visual Preference Surveys- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shown photographs of urban scenery, most people prefer images of neighborhoods and shopping centers that do not reflect the designs typically built in sprawling cities. </span></p>
<p><strong>New Urbanism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular alternative to a solution: a movement by architects and planners to build more traditional neighborhoods that foster a sense of community. New Urbanism emphasizes people, not cars. </span></p>
<p><strong>Mixed-Use Developments (MUD)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new kind of zoning classification, stresses location of residential and commercial uses in close proximity and at a greater density so that people can walk to work, stores, and schools. House types are also mixed to promote diversity. All of these alternative are seen as ways to promote neighborhood interaction instead of the sense of isolation that is characteristic of much of suburbia. </span></p>
<p><strong>Form-Based Codes- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third and more recently proposed solution to sprawl. These are zoning regulations that focus on the form of development first and foremost-building placement, building type, lot configuration, and other elements of physical form. The intent is to balance predictability and flexibility-to regulate so that the community knows what it&rsquo;s getting without constraining design too tightly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>Infill Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher-density development in smaller patches of undeveloped or redevelopable land inside the urban boundaries. </span></p>
<p><strong>Growth Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instituted by Portland in 1980. Put fixed limits on urban expansion. A planning boundary beyond which conversion of rural land uses to urban land uses is strictly prohibited. </span></p>
<p><strong>Light-Rail- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public transportation using rail at street level. Usually has a separate right-of-way on one side of a street or in a median. Unlike some streetcars and trolleys, light rail stops only at permanent stations. Operates at slower speeds, with lower capacities and costs, than subway, commuter rail, or elevated rail. </span></p>
<p><strong>Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dense nodes of housing, shops, restaurants, and offices accessible to light-rail or subway shops. </span></p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An individual or group with a strong interest or stake in how an issue is decided. Antisprawl policies must satisfy them to be successful. </span></p>
<p><strong>Scenarios- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sense of assumptions about the future that defines the basis for planning and modeling. </span></p>
<p><strong>Ecologically Sensitive Space- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fragile, rare, or valuable natural areas that are good candidates for preservation as parks, wilderness, or open space. </span></p>
<p><strong>Trade-Offs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One urban model will never fit all Americans. Geographers and planners refer to these types of situations as trade-offs, in which one objective must be sacrificed to achieve progress on another. A decision situation in which it is not possible to advance two conflicting goals simultaneously; that is, it is necessary to give up something in order to get something else. Compare with win-win situation. </span></p>
<p><strong>Win-Win Situations- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solution in which it is possible to advance two goals simultaneously. Compare with trade-off. </span></p>
<p><strong>Urban Village- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A concentration of commercial land uses and higher-density housing outside the region&rsquo;s main central business district that is planned to be a focal point of shopping and employment for surrounding residential areas. Can be the anchor point of an urban realm.The concept is loosely based on the principles of New Urbanism so that mixed-use development of homes, shops, entertainment, and work are nearby. </span></p>
<p><strong>Infill- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fills in most existing developable space in the city before new growth occurs on the periphery. The result would be a denser inner city that minimizes the spatial extent of developed land into the rural plains. </span></p>
<p><strong>Growth Boundary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One type of policy that can be used to achieve the infill strategy: literally, a line drawn on the map outside of which conversion of rural to urban land is prohibited. If such a line were drawn without including much available land, housing values would rapidly increase inside the boundary. </span></p>

<div class = "dr-g-notes">

</div>
	
<p><strong>-Political Geography- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study of the organization and distribution of political phenomena, including their impact on other spatial components of society and culture. Nationality is a basic element in cultural variation among people, and political geography traditionally has had a primary interest in country units, or states. </span></p>
<p><strong>-State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the international level, an independent political unit occupying a defined, permanently populated territory and having full sovereign control over its internal and foreign affairs. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of people with a common culture occupying a particular territory, bound together by a strong sense of unity arising from shared beliefs and customs.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Nation-State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Properly refers to a state whose territorial extent coincides with that occupied by a distinct nation or people or, at least, whose population shares a general sense of cohesion and adherence to a set of common values. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Binational/Multinational State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state that contains more than one nation. Often, no single ethnic group dominates the population. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Part-Nation State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a people&rsquo;s sense of nationality exceeds the areal limits of a single country. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Stateless Nation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A people without a state. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges To The State:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The globalization of economies and the emergence of transnational corporations whose economic and production decisions are unrelated to the interests of any single state, including their home office state.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proliferation of international and supranational institutions initially concerned with financial or security matters but all representing the voluntary surrender of some traditional state autonomy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergence and multiplication of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) whose specific interests and collective actions cut across national boundaries and unite people sharing common concerns about, for example, globalization, the environment, economic and social injustice, AIDS efforts, and the like. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive international migration flows that tend to undermine the state as a cultural community with assured and expected common values and loyalties. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in nationalist and separatist movements in culturally composite states, weakening through demands for independence or regional autonomy the former unquestioned primacy of the established state. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Compact State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most efficient form assuming no major topographical barriers: a circle with the capital located in the center. In such a country, all places could be reached from the center in a minimal amount of time and with the least expenditure for roads, railway lines, and so on. It would also have the shortest possible borders to defend. Uruguay, Zimbabwe, and Poland have roughly circular shapes, forming a compact state. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Prorupt States- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly compact but possess one or sometimes two narrow extensions of territory. Proruption may simply reflect peninsular elongations of land area, as in the case of Myanmar and Thailand.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Elongated States- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Least efficient shape administratively represented by countries like Norway, Vietnam, or Chile, which are long and narrow. The parts of the country far from the capital are likely to be isolated because great expenditures are required to link them to the core. Likely to encompass more diversity of climate, resources, and peoples.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Fragmented States- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Includes countries composed entirely of islands (Philippines, Indonesia), countries that are partly on islands and partly on the mainland (Italy, Malaysia), and those that are chiefly on the mainland but whose territory is separated by another state (US). Fragmentation makes it harder for the state to impose centralized control over its territory, particularly when the parts of the state are far from one another. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Exclave- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A special case of fragmentation occurs when a territorial outlier of one state, an exclave, is located within another country. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Enclave- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The counterpart of an exclave. Helps to define the fifth class of country shapes, the perforated state.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Perforated State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completely surrounds a territory that it does not rule as, for example, the Republic of South Africa surrounds Lesotho. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Land-Locked State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those lacking ocean frontage and surrounded by other states. Are at a commercial and strategic disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Core Area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original nucleus of a state. Usually contains its most developed economic base, densest population and largest cities, and the most highly developed transportation systems. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Unitary States- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countries with highly centralized governments, relatively few internal cultural contrasts, a strong sense of national identity, and borders that are clearly cultural as well as political boundaries. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Federal States- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In federal states, associations of more or less equal provinces or states with strong regional governmental responsibilities, the national capital city may have been newly created or selected to serve as the administrative center.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Regional Government/Asymmetric Federalism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new form of state organization; emerging in Europe as formerly strong unitary states acknowledge the autonomy aspirations of their several subdivisions and grant to them varying degrees of local administrative control while retaining in central hands authority over matters of nationwide concern, such as monetary policy, defense, foreign relations, and the like. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Forward-Thrust Capital- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A particular type of relocated capital; one that has been deliberately sited in a state&rsquo;s interior to signal the government&rsquo;s awareness of regions away from an off-center core and its interest in encouraging more uniform development.</span></p>
<p><strong>-International Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lines that establish the limit of each state&rsquo;s jurisdiction and authority. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Frontier Zones- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before boundaries were delimited, nations or empires were likely to be separated by frontier zones, ill-defined and fluctuating areas marking the effective end of a state&rsquo;s authority. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Natural (Physical) Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those based on recognizable physiographic features, such as mountains, rivers, and lakes. Although they might seem to be attractive as borders because they actually exist in the landscape and are visible dividing elements, many natural boundaries have proved to be unsatisfactory. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Geometric (Artificial) Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequently delimited as segments of parallels of latitude or meridians of longitude, they are found chiefly in Africa, Asia, and the Americans.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Antecedent Boundary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One drawn across an area before it is well populated, that is, before most of the cultural landscape features were put in place. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Subsequent- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boundaries drawn after the development of the cultural landscape.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Consequent (Ethnographic)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One type of subsequent boundary, a border drawn to accommodate existing religious, linguistic, ethnic, or economic differences between countries. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Superimposed Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequent superimposed boundaries may also be forced on existing cultural landscapes, a country, or a people by a conquering or colonizing power that is unconcerned about pre existing cultural patterns. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Relic Boundary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a formal boundary line that no longer functions as such is still marked by some landscape features or differences on the two sides, it is termed a relic boundary. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boundary Disputes:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positional Disputes- <span style="font-weight: 400;">occur when states disagree about the interpretation of documents that define a boundary and/or the way the boundary was delimited. Such disputes typically arise when the boundary is antecedent, preceding effective human settlement in the border region.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Territorial Disputes- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the ownership of a region. Often, though not always, arise when a boundary that has been superimposed on the landscape divides an ethnically homogenous population. Conflicts can arise if the people of one state want to annex a territory whose population is ethnically related to that of the state but now subject to a foreign government. This type of expansionism is called</span> irredentism <span style="font-weight: 400;">and is often a consequence of superimposed boundaries.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Resource Disputes- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Closely related to territorial conflicts. Neighboring states are likely to covet the resources--whether they be valuable mineral deposits, fertile farmland, or rich fishing grounds--lying in border areas and to disagree over their use. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Functional Disputes- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Arise when neighboring states disagree over policies to be applied along a boundary. Such policies may concern immigration, the movement of traditionally nomadic groups, customs regulations, or land use. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Centripetal Forces- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forces that promote unity and national stability in a state.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Centrifugal Forces- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forces that destabilize and weaken a state. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nationalism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An identification with the state and the acceptance of national goals. Nationalism is based on the concept of allegiance to a single country and the ideals and the way of life it represents; it is an emotion that provides a sense of identity and loyalty and of collective distinction from all other peoples and lands. In contrast to its role as a powerful centripetal agency, is also a potentially disruptive centrifugal force. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Iconography- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study of the symbols that help unite people. National anthems and other patriotic songs; flags, national sports teams, and officially designated or easily identified flowers and animals; and rituals and holidays are all developed by state to promote nationalism and attract allegiance. </span></p>
