	<p><b>Summary:</b> The AP Human Geography course is divided into seven broad content areas:
	<ol>
		<li>Geography's nature and perspectives</li>
		<li>Population</li>
		<li>Cultures</li>
		<li>Political organization of space</li>
		<li>Agricultural and rural land use</li>
		<li>Industrialization and economic development</li>
		<li>Cities and urban land use</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

<p><strong>-Space- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extent of area that is occupied by something. It can refer to physical and cultural objects on the surface of the Earth.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Relative Space-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Concerned with where something is in relation to something else and changes constantly as interrelationships between people, places, and things change.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Absolute Space-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A measurable area with definite boundaries. An essential ingredient in mapmaking (cartography) and spatial analysis of any type. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Site- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The physical location of a place.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Situation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of a place based on its relation to other places. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Place-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Another word for location. We examine place very carefully in human geography to determine the &nbsp;values and attributes that a location possesses. We often refer to a location&rsquo;s sense of place.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Placelessness-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The condition in which a place loses its sense of being special. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All places:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have location, direction, and distance from other places</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change over time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interrelate with all other places in some way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have size and scale</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possess a physical aspect and a cultural aspect</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be grouped into </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">regions </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">based on how they are alike and how they are dissimilar</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Location- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also important in the study of human geography. Related to the global grid system of latitude and longitude. Latitude is the distance north and south of the equator and is measured in equidistant lines called parallels, which decrease in length as they get closer to the north and south poles. Longitude is the distance east and west of the Prime Meridian in meridians, or lines of equal length that meet at the north and south poles. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Absolute Location-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The actual space a place occupies on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Usually referred to in mathematical form using degrees, minutes, and seconds (latitude and longitude coordinates) or even simply a street address. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Relative Location-</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Refers to the location of a place in relation to the location of other places. Vary greatly and depend on your perspective. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Scale- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The degree of generalization on a map. Is used in two very important ways in geography. First, scale can mean the frame of reference for studying something. It can also mean the size of a unit on a map as a ratio of its size on the map to the same units on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Regions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important concept because they allow us to study space, place, and locations in better detail by allowing us to generalize about a common characteristic and thus group them. A region is an area that displays a common trait such as culture, government, language, etc. Can be mapped and analyzed. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Formal (Uniform) Region- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A region with a high level of consistency in a certain cultural or physical attribute. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Functional (Nodal) Region- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A region with a node, or center hub, surrounded by interconnecting linkages. Usually connections relate to trade, communications, transportation, etc. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Perceptual (Vernacular) Region- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A region defined by feelings and prejudices that may or may not be true. A construct of one&rsquo;s mental map. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five key geographic skills presented in APHG class:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to interpret maps, graphs, tables, charts, and other spatial data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to understand and interpret the implications of relationships among observable facts (phenomena) in places. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to recognize and interpret relationships among patterns and processes at different scales. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to define regions and evaluate the regionalization process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to characterize and analyze changing interconnections among places. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Projections- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Versions of maps that try to minimize one attribute of the map but do so at the expense of the other attributes. Distortions always result from this process. The type of projection you should choose is the one that shows what you most need to know about an area. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Mental Maps- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maps in our minds. Mental images in our heads that enable us to get to our friend&rsquo;s house without getting lost or help us get from one class to another at school. Are as real as a highway map of Ohio and just as useful! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types Of Maps</span></p>
<p><strong>-General-Purpose Or Reference Map- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displays general features of an area. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Thematic Map- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displays a single type of information. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Graduated Circle-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Size of circle conveys number of occurrences of event in an area.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Dot- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displays pattern, distribution, dispersion of data in an area. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Choropleth- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displays an average value of data in an area. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simplified generalization of something in real life. Maps are a special form of model that depict information in two dimensions and usually on paper. Most models eliminate unnecessary details and isolate one or two important ideas in order to study them. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Remote Sensing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of satellite imagery provides us with images of Earth&rsquo;s features that aid us in mapping and studying various processes as they occur. This process of detecting the nature of an area from a distance is called remote sensing and has actually been around in over 150 years. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Geographic Information Systems (GIS)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marry mapping software with a database for the purpose of overlaying various data layers on a basic locational map grid. An abundance of data sets today have made GIS a valuable tool for human geographers studying questions about regional, social, and economic problems or analyzing physical processes as they impact human behaviors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-The two main questions geography answers are &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Maps have long been the primary tool of geographers when answering the question of &ldquo;where&rdquo; places and activities are located on the surface of the Earth. To answer the &ldquo;why&rdquo; question, geographers must turn to the processes of </span><strong>spatial interaction </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><strong>diffusion. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationships between the members of your community depend on the type and kind of human interaction that occurs among the community members. In the same way, the interconnectedness between places depends on the amount of spatial interaction between them. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spatial Diffusion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spread of something over time or space. The two basic types of diffusion are relocation and expansion. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spatial Distribution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refers to the array of items on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. All spatial distributions have density, dispersion, and some type of pattern. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Type Of Diffusion- </span></p>
<p><strong>-Relocation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical transfer of idea, trait, or artifact to new region.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Expansion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread of idea, trait, or artifact usage to neighboring region. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Hierarchical- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread of ideas, etc. first to ruler, king, or highest authority and then downward to subjects or less prominent people.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Contagious- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idea, trait, etc. spreads evenly outward from diffusion origin or hearth. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Stimulus- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spread of a general concept throughout a population. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Density- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of an item within a unit of area. It is more than just a count of an item-it refers to how many of that item is in a limited space or area. </span></p>

<div class = "rapid-review">
<p><br /><strong>Rapid Review: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human geography is the study of why people choose to live where they do. The study of human geography involves the use of maps, models, and spatial analysis technologies as a means of abstracting and simplifying space and all it contains for study. Maps depict a three-dimensional Earth in two dimensions, are inherently flawed due to this, and are designed with special purposes that should match the needs of the map-user. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-2">Chapter 2: Population</h2> 

	<div class = "summary">
	<p><b>Summary</b>: In AP Human Geography, we look at population through the double lenses of space and place. 
	Human populations have moved and settled in various locations for many years. What factors 
	cause them to move to a new location? What makes up a population? What determines whether a 
	population will grow or decline? This chapter reviews the basic concepts of population composition, dynamics, movements, settlement patterns,
	and how people relate to places.</p> 
	</div>

	<p><strong>-Demography- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study of the characteristics of a human population. It is useful to examine some facts about a population before studying the human-environmental interactions that follow.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Population Density- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of persons per unit of land area.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Ecumene- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The part of the Earth that is fit for humans to live. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Physiological Density- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most helpful way to express the density of humans on the surface of the Earth. THe number of persons per unit of agricultural land. This number is helpful because it gives us a rough estimate of how many people a parcel of farmland can reasonably support. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Agricultural Density- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refers to the number of people living in rural areas per unit of agricultural land. This figure omits people who live in cities and provides an estimate of the number of people actually living off the farmlands. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Crude Density- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as arithmetic density. Possibly the most general and least useful statistic. This is the number of people per unit of land. All you have to do is divide the total land area of a region, country, or other land area by the total population to compute the arithmetic density. As the unit of land area increases, in size, the crude density figure becomes less meaningful since it &ldquo;blends in&rdquo; the urban populations and masks the sparsely inhabited areas into one fairly useless average.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Carrying Capacity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defined as how many people an area can support on a sustained basis, relates to density because together, they define whether or not an area is overcrowded. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Population Distribution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pattern of where humans live. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movement of humans from one place to another. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both the </span><strong>crude birth rate (CBR) </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the </span><strong>total fertility rate (TFR) </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">reflect on the number of births in a population, they differ in important ways. The BR measures the number of babies born per 1000 people, and the TFR measures the number of babies born per reproductive-age woman. The TFR is a more accurate measure of the amount of reproduction occurring in a population. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Crude Death Rate (CDR)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual number of deaths per 1000 people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-HIV/AIDS is the fourth most common cause of death worldwide. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Rate Of Natural Increase (NIR)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Doubling Time- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of time it takes for a country&rsquo;s population to double in size if the growth rate stays the same. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Population Momentum- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of population momentum, it can be very difficult to project what a population will be like in the future. Population momentum means that even though the fertility rates may be decreasing, the population can still be increasing. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Demographic Transition Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to sow the link between population growth and economic development. The stages in demographic transition are as follows: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage 1: Slow population growth, when the birth and death rates are both high.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage 2: The population increases greatly as the death rate drops and birth rate stays high.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage 3: The population growth slows because of a falling birth rate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stage 4: The rate of natural increase is low or decreasing because of low death rates and low birth rates. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Replacement Level- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.1. Necessary to assure the population continues to replace itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Zero Population Growth (ZPG)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A condition in which births plus immigration equal deaths plus emigration for individual countries, would present unique socioeconomic problems. These socioeconomic problems would be made worse by shrinking national and international economies. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Population Pyramid- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The composition of a population is represented in a population pyramid, or age-sex pyramid. This graph shows the number of males and females in any given population by age group, or cohort. Population pyramids can help predict the future needs of a country&rsquo;s population. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Dependency Ratio- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratio of people under age 15 and those 65 and older to those aged 15 to 65. Gives us a good idea how many workers are required to support the dependent population. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Immigrate- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people move into a country.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Emigrate- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people exit a country. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Several Migration Principles, proposed by geographer E.G. Ravenstein in the 1880s-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move only a short distance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually settle in urban areas if moving long distances.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move in steps.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move from rural to urban. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start a migration flow that produces a movement in the opposite direction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are adults (families with children are less likely to move).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If international, are young males whereas more internal migrants are female, but this has changed recently. Now, from 40 to 60 percent of international migrants are female. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Push Factors- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that encourage leaving.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Pull Factors- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that pull the migrant to the new location. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Place Utility- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">All moves are influenced by place utility, which is the person&rsquo;s satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a place. People will choose whether to remain or move based on place utility.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Distance Decay- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principle that says migrants try to minimize the friction of distance. This means that migrants will be more inclined to move to locations closer to them; they will be less interested in moving to distant locations. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Intervening Opportunity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that migrants will choose a location closer rather than farther if all other factors are roughly the same. The closer opportunities will appear more attractive to the migrant than those farther away. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Migrants</span></p>
<p><strong>-Immigrant- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is entering another country with the intention of living there. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Emigrant- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is leaving one country with the intention of living in a different country. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Refugee- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is residing outside the country of his or her origin because of fear of persecution because of religion, ethnicity, race, or political ideology. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Internally Displaced Person (IDP)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is forced out of the home region because of war, political or social unrest, environmental problems, etc. but does not cross any international boundaries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forms Of Migration</span></p>
<p><strong>-Step Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series of small moves to reach destination.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Chain Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of a migrant flow that &nbsp;follows former migrants to an area.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Counter Or Return Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, about 25 percent will return to home area eventually. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Channelized Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repetitive pattern of migration not linked to family or ethnicity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Human Capital Theory Of Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educated workers often migrate from poor countries to wealthy countries seeking better-paying jobs. This movement of human capital benefits both countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>-Life Course Theory Of Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">States that the interaction of life course events (becoming married, having a child, becoming divorced) with migration have important repercussions on a society. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class = "rapid-review">
	<p><strong>Rapid Review: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Population and human migrations are themes that are integral to the study of AP Human Geography. Geographers study the spatial distributions of humans and their movements by looking at demographic statistics such as CBR, CDR, TFR, and age-sex pyramids, and by analyzing the impact and rationale for migrations. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-3">Chapter 3: Culture</h2>

<div class = "summary">
<p><b>Summary:</b> This chapter focuses on the cultural traits, behaviors, and patterns that make 
a group of people different and unique from other groups. It also reviews the spatial patterns and 
diffusion of culture traits and ook at how cultural landscapes evolve over time.<br>Culture, or what
makes a group of people special and unique, is an important part of AP Human Geography. All the parts
of a culture--both material and nonmaterial--create unique landscapes called <b>cultural landscapes</b>
that help human geographers differentiate between groups and societies. The study of the diffusion and 
spread of innovations, cultural traits, and culture systems is integral to AP Human Geography. 
</div>

<p><strong>-Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lifestyle, beliefs, and values of a group of people. Even the definition of family is part of a group&rsquo;s culture. Culture is transferred within a society by imitation, instruction, and example and is learned, not inherited, from your parents.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Culture Trait- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single feature of a culture. For example, the type of clothing and the system of religious beliefs of a group of people.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Culture Complex- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of individual cultural traits that are interconnected.. (e.g. keeping cattle is cultural trait. Culture complex is comprised of related traits of cattle as a measure of wealth, the imbibing of milk, etc). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Material Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Composed of </span><strong>artifacts </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(tangible things) such as tools, weapons, and furniture. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nonmaterial Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Made up of </span><strong>mentifacts </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(language, religion, artistic pursuits, folk stories, myths, etc.) and </span><strong>sociofacts </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(educational and political institutions, religious organizations, family structure, etc). The distinctions are not always clear cut. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Cultural Diffusion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process in which culture spreads from one region to another. Diffusion involves the movement of people, ideas, and goods from one location to another. A culture trait such as language, religion, or housing style is spread from one area to another through a form of cultural diffusion. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Culture Hearth- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A place where innovations and new ideas originate and spread outward (diffuse) to other regions. Examples: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus River Valley, West Africa. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Innovations- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">New inventions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Cultural Barriers- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hindrances to diffusion. Sometimes cultural barriers occur in a society and keep cultural traits from spreading. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Taboo- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potent form of cultural barrier that prevents certain habits or new ideas from establishing themselves in a society because of already-established prohibitions, customs, and rules. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Acculturation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change that occurs when a culture when it adopts a practice from another culture. The process of adopting </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">some </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the values, customs, and behaviors of the host culture. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Transculturation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occurs when an equal exchange of traits or influence between two culture groups occurs.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Syncretism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The birth of a new culture trait from blending two or more cultural traits. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Assimilation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process in which immigrants become totally integrated into the host culture. The immigrants are still often aware of the differences between the two cultures, thus retaining their ethnic identity. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Globalization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing interconnection of all regions in the world through politics, communication, transportation, marketing, manufacturing, and social and cultural processes The increasing amount of connectivity in the world today presents a multitude of spatial advantages and also some problems. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Culture Region- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A portion of the Earth&rsquo;s surface occupied by populations sharing recognizable and distinctive cultural characteristics. Examples: spatial extent of the Muslim region, area in which English is widely spoken. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Environmental Determinism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endorsed by geographer Ellsworth Huntington and others. This theory states that human behavior is controlled by the physical environment. Is no longer accepted.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Possibilism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theory that the physical environment merely establishes limits of what is possible on the human population; has been more widely accepted in recent years although it, too, raises questions. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">theory that the environment sets certain constraints or limitations, but culture is otherwise determined by social conditions</span></p>
<p><strong>-Language Family- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of languages that are related and derived from a single, earlier language-the </span><strong>protolanguage, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a reconstructed ancestral language. It can be further divided into subfamilies, branches, or groups of languages that are related. Largest family: Indo-European, spoke by roughly half the world&rsquo;s population. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Hierarchical Diffusion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adoption of an official language by the ruler or administration, diffused a language downwards into the society. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Lingua Franca- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A language that is informally agreed upon as the language of business and trade. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Dialects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speech variants; reflects the local region in which they are spoken. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Pidgin Or Creole- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pidgin or creole languages are simplified mixtures of two or more languages that are adopted in areas of cultural diversity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Types Of Religion</span></p>
<p><strong>-Universalizing Religion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A religion in which anyone can become a member. Dominating: Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnic Religion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One that is part of a particular ethnic or political group. Outsiders cannot join because they must be born into this ethnic group to practice the religion, although one can marry into an ethnic religion. Examples: Judaism, Hinduism. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Traditional (Tribal) Religion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethnic religions that are practiced by small, local cultural groups. They are typically blended religions that combine the belief system of the ethnic group, tribe, or village, with animism and perhaps imposed religions. (many in Indonesia). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Sequent Occupance- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process by which a landscape is gradually modified by a succession of occupying groups. The concept that successive societies leave their cultural imprints on a place, each contributing to the cumulative cultural landscape. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Animism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The belief that spirits (Including ancestral) live within objects such as animals, rivers, rocks, trees, and mountains. Practiced in: Malaysia, Africa, Australia, and most indigenous groups throughout the world. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Shamanism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A form of tribal, or traditional religion that reveres a particular person, the shaman, as one with special healing or magic powers. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Secularism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rejection of all religious beliefs and is spreading rapidly in certain areas of the world such as Europe. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Hinduism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oldest major world religion; it arose in the Indus River Valley in Pakistan. This polytheistic religion spread by contagious diffusion into the Indian subcontinent displacing native religions. Today over 80% of the world&rsquo;s Hindu population lives in India. One must be born into this belief system of hundreds of gods and multitudes of rituals to participate. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Judaism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerged slightly later than Hinduism, around 3000 to 4000 years ago, in the Mesopotamian culture hearth in Southwest Asia (the Middle East). Judaism is the oldest of the three main monotheistic world religions. It is an ethnic religion in which members are bound by a strict set of rules and dictates that include dietary restrictions. Religious persecution led to a diaspora of Jews throughout the world, but their homeland is Israel. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Christianity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Began with the birth of Jesus, a Jewish carpenter, whom Christians believe is the Messiah promised by God. A proselytizing religion because Jesus proclaimed God&rsquo;s love and salvation to everyone, not just the Jewish people. The expansion of the Roman Empire throughout Europe spread Christianity throughout most of Europe by expansion and hierarchical diffusion. Later, relocation diffusion brought the faith to the New World at the hands of Spanish priests and conquistadores. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Islam- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last of the three main monotheistic religions to be birthed. Based on the teachings of Mohammed. The Koran is the sacred book of Islam, and Muslims adhere closely to the strict tenets of the religion as stated in this book. The Five Pillars: 1) repetition of the Muslim creed 2) prayer five times daily 3) observance of Ramadan (month of fasting) 4) almsgiving, and 5) a pilgrimage to Mecca before one&rsquo;s death. Spread rapidly by expansion diffusion throughout Southwest Asia and into India after Mohammed&rsquo;s death in AD 632. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Buddhism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-theistic religion (some say it is a philosophy) that does not believe in worshipping gods but rather in seeking and discovering the truth for one&rsquo;s self. Began in sixth century B.C.E. in present-day Nepal. Based on the meditations and teachings of Buddha, the Enlightened One, an Indian prince who spent his life pondering the mysteries of life, death, and suffering. Two main branches: Theravada and Mahayana. </span></p>
<p><strong>-East Asian Ethnic Religions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddhism merged with ethnic religions when it arrived in Asia. In Japan, the syncretism of Shintoism (traditional religion based on nature and ancestor worship) and Buddhism formed a special type of Buddhism. In China, Confucianism (system of ethics and family behavior) and Taoism (a philosophy based on living a peaceful life in tune with nature) blended with Buddhism to form a syncretic religion that combined elements of all three belief systems. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Ethnic Group- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A population that shares common roots based on culture, religion, race, language, or nationality. Ethnic groups have long migrated to other locations in search of a better future for themselves and their families. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Race- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not the same as ethnicity. Refers to a group of people with a common biological ancestor. The members of a race have distinguishing physical characteristics that make them look different from members of other races. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnocentrism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The belief that one&rsquo;s own ethnic group is superior to all others. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnicity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very spatial concept. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>-First Effective Settlement- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term used by Geographer Wilbur Zelinsky to refer to the first group-or </span><strong>charter group</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- of settlers to establish a new and lasting culture and society in an area. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnic Island- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small ethnic settlement centered in the middle of a larger group of the population. Example: Germans in Texas Hill County. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnic Enclaves- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small areas of cities that are inhabited by a minority cultural group. Most large cities have ethnic enclaves. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Toponyms- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place names. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Host Society- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominant culture group receiving minority group. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tipping Point- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a charter group neighborhood reaches a critical number of minority inhabitants, the tipping point is reached and the charter group quickly leaves the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Ghetto- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ethnic enclave where the residents are either voluntarily or forced to live segregated (separated) by race, religion, or ethnicity in a voluntary or sometimes, forced, manner. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Popular (Pop) Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ever-changing cultural norms associated with a large, diverse group of people who are very influenced by mass media, mass production, and mass merchandising. Examples: McDonalds, Michael Jackson, Wii. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Folk Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refers to a homogenous group of people with a strong family structure who follow a simple, traditional lifestyle of self-sufficiency and independence from the society&rsquo;s cultural mainstream. Example: Old Order Amish. Tends to be highly localized and clustered with little interaction with the main cultural group. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Material Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical items of culture such as furniture and clothing.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Nonmaterial Culture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intangible mentifacts and sociofacts such as customs and social behaviors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Cultural Landscape- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Made up of the structures placed on the physical landscape by human activities or, how people arrange the physical space around them. Includes any change to the natural landscape. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Land Survey- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land survey methods for parceling out land to its occupants differ according to the charter group&rsquo;s ethnicity in the United States and Canada. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Metes-And-Bounds System- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Led to numerous disputes whenever a boundary tree was uprooted by a storm!</span></p>
<p><strong>-Rectangular-Survey System- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopted by the United States after independence from England. Uses rectangular grid divisions to divide new land settlements. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Long-Lot System- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">French system, used by French charter group in the Mississippi and St. Lawrence River valleys. Gave each settler access to river frontage and fertile alluvial soil while extending the long lots outward several acres to give them additional grazing and farm lands. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Vernacular Regions- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular regions named for the way people perceive them. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Sense Of Place- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special perception we have of a certain place based on our feelings, emotions, and associations with that place. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Placelessness- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss of a place&rsquo;s unique flavor and identity because of the standardizing influence of popular culture and globalization. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Built Environment- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The material culture of an environment. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div class = "rapid-review">
<p><strong>Rapid Review: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culture is a combination of material artifacts, values, and political traditions. Language, religion, and ethnicity are cultural values. Human geography is interested in how these values are distributed and diffused spatially throughout the various regions of the world. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-4">Chapter 4: The Political Organization Of Space</h2>

<div class = "summary">
<p><b>Summary:</b> This chapter reviews how humans have organized the surface of the Earth into 
countries (also called states) and the conflicts that sometimes arise. The political geography of
the Earth changes constantly as boundaries and borders change. THe boundaries of countries change suddenly
sometimes (for example, in war and armed conflict) or change gradually as states devolve (for example, in the case 
of the USSR). Alliances and the forces of globalization greatly impact the political geographer of the Earth today.</p>
</div>


<p><strong>-States- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political units dividing the earth. The term state refers to a country and not a political subdivision within the US, such as Nevada or Maine. Each country has a defined population and borders, in other words, boundaries that are defined. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A unified group of people with a common culture. Examples: Kurds, Navajo, and Roma. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nation-State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state in which over 90 percent of the population is comprised of a specific culture or group of people. Examples: Japan, Iceland, Armenia, Bangladesh, and Lesotho. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Growth Pole- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing people and jobs into the undeveloped interior.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Forward Capital- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Islamabad is a forward capital that makes a bold statement to the rest of the world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shapes Of Countries:</span></p>
<p><strong>-Compact- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Round. Easy for defense and communications among all areas.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Prorupt Or Protruded- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Round with a large extension (panhandle). Increases access to resources such as water. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Elongated- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long, narrow. Difficult communications between areas. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Fragmented- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two or more areas separated by another country or body of water. Difficult communications between areas. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Perforated- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally surrounds another country. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Landlocked- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">No access to water. Trade difficulties because of lack of ports. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Antecedent Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boundaries placed before the cultural landscape developed. In other words, very early in the area&rsquo;s settlement history.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Subsequent Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are drawn after the cultural landscape is in place. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Consequent Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A type of boundary that is drawn to accommodate existing language, religious, or other cultural boundaries. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Superimposed Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes forced on existing boundaries as in the case of the division of Africa by European colonial powers during the nineteenth century. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Relic Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old boundaries that are no longer used between countries such as the now nonexistent boundary between North and South Vietnam.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Irredentism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation that arises when an ethnic group supports and seeks to reunite with its ethnic population in a neighboring country. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Imperialism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of military threat, cultural domination, and economic sanctions to gain control of a country and its resources.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Colonialism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imposed a set of formal controls by the mother country over its colonies or outside territories. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Decolonization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process by which former colonies gain their independence. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Heartland-Rimland Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by Halford Mackinder, an English geographer, to justify European colonization during the nineteenth century. He claimed the core of Eurasia was the heartland, and the surrounding territories comprised the rimland. The heartland was well positioned to dominate the world because of the immense size of its land mass. Since Russia formed a major part of the heartland, Mackinder influenced politicians of the day to try and limit Russia&rsquo;s expansion by colonizing the territories near Russia. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Domino Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular anti-communist theory between 1945 and 1990 that greatly influenced the foreign policy decisions of the US during this time period. Stated that once a country became communist, the neighboring countries around it were likely to also become communist, like a column of dominoes falling over, one by one. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Terrorism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased in use in recent years as a tool of intimidation and coercion. Terrorism is the use of violence in a controlled and intentional way to force attention onto issues. Terrorist attacks are aimed at a population and not a particular person. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State-Sponsored Terrorism Three Escalating Levels Of Participation:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state provides sanctuary for those who have committed acts of terrorism.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state provides weapons, military intelligence, and money to terrorists.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state plans acts of terrorism. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state guilty of any one or all of the above is to be viewed as a state that sponsors terrorism. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Supranational- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An association of three or more states for mutual benefit. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Sovereignty- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refers to the internationally recognized exercise of a country&rsquo;s power over its people and territory. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Federal State- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A type of government that gives local political units (such as states or provinces) within a country a measure of power. Examples: US, Canada, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and India. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Unitary States- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allocate most of the power to a strong central government: France, Sweden. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Confederation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the breakup of its strong centralized authoritarian government, most of the former Soviet republics joined a confederation of states to retain some cohesion. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Exclave- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An outlier (piece of a country that is separate from the main territory) that is enclosed within the borders of another country. Example: Nagorno-Karabakh.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Enclave- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A piece of territory that is completely surrounded by another territory of which it is not a part. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countries are constantly subjected to </span><strong>centripetal forces </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">that unite and </span><strong>centrifugal forces </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">that divide. When unifying forces (centripetal) dominate, the country will stand strong in the face of international challenges and conflicts, as well as conflicts within its borders. When forces within threaten to divide the country (centrifugal), a breakdown of central authority may occur. Forces such as a strong, charismatic leader, national anthems, national holidays, and national institutions such as schools are all strong centripetal forces in a country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Nationalism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong love of and loyalty to one&rsquo;s country. Also a potent unifying force. Involves the concept that a nation has the right to govern itself without the interference of others. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Separatism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationalism can also serve to divide a country when an ethnic or a cultural minority seeks political autonomy or the right to self-governance. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Devolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown or weakening of central authority. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Alliances- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associations among countries for the purpose of mutual defense or trade purposes. Some are on a regional scale, and some are on an international scale. Some are for political, military, or defense purposes, and others are economic in purpose. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Law Of The Sea</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Under this treaty, a coastal state has:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive fishing rights and sovereignty over a territorial sea of up to 12 nautical miles from its coast.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited jurisdiction over a territorial sea up to 24 nautical miles from its coast (the right to enforce laws of immigration, sanitation, hot pursuit).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><strong>exclusive economic zone (EEZ) </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of up to 200 nautical miles off its coast for natural resource exploration and exploitation. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Gerrymandering- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of redrawing territorial district boundaries to benefit a certain political party. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div class = "rapid-review">
<p><strong>Rapid Review: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The countries of the world (states) are political units with constantly changing boundaries, associations, alliances, and concerns. They are subject to forces that unify and divide and are greatly influenced by conflicts both within and outside their borders. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-5">Chapter 5: Agricultural And Rural Land Use</h2>

<div class = "summary">
<p><b>Summary:</b> Agriculture is a primary economic activity that is found in almost every country of the world. Everyone depends on agriculture to survive. Over the centuries, agriculture has changed from a small and isolated practice into 
a worldwide mega-industry. Agriculture is constantly changing as new technologies and products make it increasingly efficient. It takes many forms and has gone through distinct changes and phases as it globalizes. The effedcts of agriculture--
both large and small--on the human population are an important part of the study of AP Human Geography.</p>
</div>


<p><strong>-Primary Economic Activity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture is called a primary economic activity because it involves taking something from the Earth. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Sedentary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settling down in one location. </span></p>
<p><strong>-First Agricultural Revolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution. These sedentary societies modified their natural environment so they could grow surplus crops by using irrigation and storage techniques. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Second Agricultural Revolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Started in the seventeenth century in Europe and North America. Increased efficiency of crop production and distribution. Initially, as crop yields increased because of the horse-drawn hoe and seed drill in England, people ate healthier because more food was available at lower prices. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Agribusiness- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial farming enterprises that emphasized single crops and profits. The evolution from the single farm to the integrated production and marketing partnership model.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Green Revolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Began in the mid-1970s when scientists developed hybrid higher-yield seeds and new fertilizers to use with them. Scientists were trying to use intensive agricultural technology to help poor countries produce larger harvests without farming larger acreage. These new seeds and fertilizers were diffused from core to periphery countries during this time to aid in producing a larger harvest and to help eradicate hunger. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Modern Commercial Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large-scale agricultural production for profit using specialized methods, technologies, and genetically engineered seeds. MDCs like the US and Canada use specialized agricultural methods to raise crops for profit. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Vertical Integration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contracts between farmer and purchasing/processing company; caused farm outputs to increase by the 1990s. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Subsistence Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consumption of everything that is grown, gradually took over hunting and gathering. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Shifting Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on growing crops in different fields on a rotating basis. Example: The Maya in the Yucatan grow maize by rotating fields on a seven-year cycle. The fields are cut and burned off each year to enrich the soil with nutrients. Seeds are planted just in time for the rainy season. This is also called swidden agriculture or slash-and-burn and is prevalent in locations such as the Amazon Basin. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Intensive Subsistence Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depends on heavy inputs of fertilizer and human labor on a small piece of land for substantial crop yield. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Polyculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producement of several crops. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Urban Subsistence Farming- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urban subsistence farming in the form of small city gardens is a rapidly growing activity and accounts for one-seventh of the world&rsquo;s food production according to recent UN figures. These gardens form an important source of sustenance for poor urban families unable to buy adequate food for their families. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Pastoralism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A form of subsistence agriculture in which animals are herded in a seasonal migratory pattern. Today, there are nearly 200 million pastoralists in the world who breed and herd cattle, goats, sheep, camels and reindeer. Pastoralism is found in arid, marginal lands, such as deserts and steppes where rainfall is scarce and unreliable-sufficient for grazing grasses but not enough for other forms of subsistence farming. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Transhumance- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pastoralists move their herds constantly in a set seasonal pattern of grazing (from mountain to valley pastures, for example).</span></p>
<p><strong>-Monoculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When farmers grow one crop. Example: grain farming.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Mediterranean Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another form of specialized agriculture that is known for producing grapes, olives, citrus, and figs-crops requiring a warm year-round climate with plenty of summer sunshine. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Truck Farming- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial gardening and fruit farming; the predominant agricultural activity in the Southeast. Most of the fruits and vegetables grown are sold to large processing companies, but some are also sold to individual consumers. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Specialty Farming- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides upscale customers in New England with fresh produce. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Von Thunen&rsquo;s Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to markets is a huge problem for farmers all over the world. Von Thunen&rsquo;s model, proposed by a German geographer, helps explain the relationship between the cost of land and the cost to transport the crop to market. The closer the land is to the city, the more expensive it is, and the farther away, the cheaper it is. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main Assumptions Of Von Thunen&rsquo;s Model:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolated State: <span style="font-weight: 400;">no trade with the outside world</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Land characteristics uniform: <span style="font-weight: 400;">flat land with uniform fertility around the city. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Transportation: <span style="font-weight: 400;">no roads or rivers, just farmers with carts and horses for transportation of products. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 Factors Affect The Pattern Of Rural Settlement:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kind of resource that attracts people the the area (forests, farmland).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transportation methods available at time of settlement (rivers, roads).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role of government policy, especially the land survey system (metes-and-bounds, long lot, rectangular, etc). </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Biotechnology- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The application of scientific techniques to modify and improve plants, animals, and microorganisms to enhance their value. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Genetically Modified Organism (GMO)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created when scientists take one or more specific genes from an organism (including plants, animals, bacteria, or viruses) and introduce those genes into another organism. An organism that has been transformed using genetic engineering techniques is called a transgenic organism, or a genetically modified organism. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Organic Farming- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of producing food naturally. Avoids the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers and genetically organisms to influence the growth of crops. The organic farmer strives to protect the Earth&rsquo;s resources and produce safe healthy, food for consumption with zero-impact on the environment. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Desertification- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The turning of agricultural land into deserts through use of overgrazing and the subsequent erosion of unprotected topsoils by winds. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Sustainability- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principle that we must meet our present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Sustainability emphasizes the stewardship of both natural and human resources. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Conservation Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new way of farming based on optimizing crop yields and profits without depleting soil, encouraging erosion, and harming the environment. Conservation agriculture methods include reduced use of fossil fuels, pesticides, and other pollutants thus keeping the environment safer for the inhabitants, too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Conservation Practices:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conservation crop rotation: <span style="font-weight: 400;">planting low-residue (low-fiber) crops such as soybeans in one year, followed by a high residue crop, such as corn in the following year on the same field. </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Conservation tillage: <span style="font-weight: 400;">allowing the crop residue to stay on top of the field, rather than being plowed under when the planting begins. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Terraces: <span style="font-weight: 400;">creating an embankment (a terrace) at a right angle to sloping land in order to allow water to soak into the soil rather than to move down the slope, taking the soil with it.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Grassed waterways: <span style="font-weight: 400;">creating a broad and shallow depression, usually below a terraced area, that is planted with grasses to prevent erosion by slowing the flow of runoff, holding a bank, and filtering out soil particles. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rapid Review: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture is a global industry that has changed and evolved through the years from being an isolated family farm to a multimillion-dollar commercial agribusiness. The foods we eat every day come from global communities far away. Can we raise crops in a sustainable way without harming our planet?</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-6">Chapter 6: Industrialization And Economic Development</h2>

<div class = "summary">
<p><b>Summary:</b> This chapter reviews the spatial nature of industrial ecoomies and contempoary global patterns of industrialization and resource extraction. The world's
industrial regions and major industrial location theories are largely based on human behavior, as well
as the workings of a market economy. What is happening now in the world's industrial regions is not always the same as what occurred in
the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Today, as industrialization occurs in one region, deindustrialization happens in another.</p>
</div>


<p><strong>-Developed Countries (DCs or &ldquo;The Core&rdquo;)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have the highest levels of economic development. Examples: US, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, etc.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Less-Developed Countries (LDCs)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are located on the semi-periphery or periphery of the global economy and include the former communist countries (example: Romania, Bulgaria) and Third &nbsp;World countries (Nigeria, Kenya). These countries are seeking an improved standard of living that is often achieved by industrialization of the economy and the transition from an agrarian-based system to one centered on manufacturing or trade. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gross Domestic Product (GDP)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measures the level of development in a country. An approximation of the total value of all final goods and services produced by a country per year. &ldquo;Final&rdquo; refers to the finished end product to avoid double counting. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gross National Product (GNP)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GDP plus the value of income from abroad such as earnings from a US company like Intel, which produces silicon chips is Leixlip, County Kildare, Ireland. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mandate recently developed by the UN designed to erase poverty by the year 2015. The eight development goals that comprise this mandate are targeted. At the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women through the provision of better healthcare, hunger eradication, and basic universal education. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Sustainable Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept that it is possible to balance economic growth without jeopardizing the environment and equitable human access. It is important to determine what level of development a country can maintain without jeopardizing the future of its inhabitants to continue at that level. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Activities:</span></p>
<p><strong>-Primary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extraction of natural resource.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Secondary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing of raw materials into finished goods by manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Tertiary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provision of services.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Quaternary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information and knowledge processing.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Quinary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highest-level decision making. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Secondary Economic Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add value by changing a material into a more useful product (form utility); are generally performed in the core and semi-periphery countries.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Tertiary Economic Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those that provide services such as wholesale and retail jobs, tourism, and restaurant work.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Quaternary Economic Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really high-order tertiary activities that the most developed countries abound in such as white-collar workers in education, information processing, and government.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Quinary Economic Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest level of quaternary economic activities is sometimes classified as quinary. Reserved for those who are the highest-level decision makers in both the government and private sectors of the economy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Sometimes there is disagreement about how to classify an economic activity, but in general, primary refers to basic extraction of a resource from the earth, secondary is the processing of that resource into a finished product, tertiary refers to the service sector, and quaternary deals with information handling and processing. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Rostow&rsquo;s Model Of Economic Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also called modernization theory. Is based on stages of economic growth and modernization. The first stage of development is a traditional subsistence economy based mainly on farming with very limited technology. When the levels of technology within a country develop and the development of a transportation system encourages trade, the second stage-preconditions for take-off-is reached. During the third stage-take-off-more transportation systems and infrastructure are built and manufacturing industries grow rapidly. Growth poles emerge as investment increases. By stage four-the drive to maturity--growth is self-sustaining, and leads to an increase in the number and types of industry. During this stage, more complex transport systems and manufacturing expand as transportation develops, rapid urbanization occurs, and traditional industries may decline. In Rostow&rsquo;s fifth and final stage, the age of mass consumption, a rapid expansion of tertiary industries occurs while manufacturing declines. Rostow&rsquo;s model assumes periphery countries only need to modernize to achieve greater economic development and that the role of core countries is to provide foreign aid and industrial technology to help them. Example: Green Revolution. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons Of The Model:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It attempts to fit all countries into the Western/European historical mold.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is geared toward large countries, thus leaving out small ones, such as Gambia and Burundi.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is linear when many times economic development occurs nonlinearly in &ldquo;fits-and-starts.&rdquo;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is based on high-consumption Western ideals. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Developmentalism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notion that every country and region will eventually make economic progress toward a high level of mass consumption if they only compete to the best of their ability within the world economy. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Dependency Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Andre Gunder Frank in the 1970s. A theory of economic development based on the periphery&rsquo;s dependence on the core. He believed that the core exploits resources in the periphery resulting in the periphery&rsquo;s dependence on the core as it imports the core&rsquo;s finished products. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Neocolonialism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The periphery is forced to take on a dependent role in the global economy, starting in colonial times and continuing today in the form of neocolonialism. </span></p>
<p><strong>-World-Systems Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by Immanuel Wallerstein in the 1970s when the Third World and the Cold War were commonly accepted terms. He claimed that there is only one world--a complex world-system--in which nation-states compete for capital and labor. He saw the global economy as a market system with a fluid and dynamic flow of countries and economies from periphery to semi-periphery to core. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determining The Location Of Industrial Activity:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessibility to material inputs such as raw materials and energy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relative importance of the following inputs: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. labor needed to produce the product</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cost of land, plant, machinery (fixed costs)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wages, salaries, utility bills, local taxes, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Demand of the market for the good or service.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Transfer costs (transporting inputs from sources and outputs to markets; costs of storing, insuring, unloading, etc. of raw materials and finished goods). </span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influence of government policies and cultural factors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influence of behavioral considerations. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Least-Cost Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by Alfred Weber; states that three main expenses must be minimized in locating an industry--labor costs, transportation costs, and agglomeration costs, with transportation costs being the most important. He used a locational triangle diagram to determine the optimal location using the approximate weights of raw materials and finished products along with distances. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Agglomeration Effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also important in determining where to locate an industry. The cost advantages (external economies) for an individual company gained by locating near similar functional industries or companies. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Localization Economies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost savings for individual industries as a result of grouping together in a certain location (example: Silicon Valley). </span></p>
<p><strong>-Backwash Effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative impacts. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spread Effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also occur, in which the peripheral region benefits from the economic growth of the core region by growing too.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Growth Poles- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locations for economic activity that are specifically grouped around a high-growth industry. The location of dynamic, high-growth industries in a region gives that region a valuable economic boost. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Locational Interdependence Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A theory developed by economist Harold Hotelling. This theory suggests competitors, in trying to maximize sales, will seek to limit each other&rsquo;s territory as much as possible by locating close to each other in the middle of their combined customer base. If both sellers are equidistant from their potential customers, neither has a greater advantage.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Profit Maximization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third important theory in locating a new industry. Based on finding the location where net profit would be greatest. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Footloose- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the firm produces something that requires minimal transport costs, it is called a footloose industry (example: Computers).</span></p>
<p><strong>-Substitution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Import substitution is the production of good sand services internally by the periphery country that were once supplied by the core.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Deindustrialization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a core region witnesses decreased industrial employment as industries respond to decreased profits. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Creative Destruction- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reinvestment of funds in new, profitable ventures and regions that once were used to fund older, less profitable ventures and regions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Industrial Revolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Began in the late 1700s in England and led to the astronomical growth of population for the next two centuries as industrialization diffused outward first across the Atlantic Ocean into British colonies in North America and then east into Europe. Steam engine, textile industry, coal deposits, engineering. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Fordism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of using assembly-line techniques and scientific management in manufacturing and is attributed to Henry Ford.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Neo-Fordism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evolution of mass production with a more responsive system geared to the nuances of mass consumption. It uses flexible production systems that allow production processes to be shifted quickly from production of one product to another with very little downtime in the assembly line.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Export-Processing Zones (EPZs)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small areas with exceptional investment and trading conditions that governments create to stimulate and attract foreign investment. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Commodity Chain- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chain of activities from the manufacturing to the distribution of a product. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Transnational Corporations (TNCs)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also referred to as multinational corporations or MNCs. Found at the high-profit end of the commodity chain and specialize in brand names, high technology, and design and marketing functions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-World Cities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those in which a very large proportion of global finance and banking transactions take place. New York City, London, Paris, Tokyo. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Globalization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than just the homogenization of cultures and ideologies created by better technology and communications networks. It also involves the increasingly fluid movement of economic goods and services between and among countries and regions of the world. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Comparative Advantage- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production of a commodity by a country that has the most favorable ratio of advantage or the least unfavorable ratio of disadvantage compared to other countries. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Outsourcing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The practice of shifting production of a product to a third party either in the country in which you are based on in another country. An offshoot of comparative advantage.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Maquiladoras- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign-owned assembly companies located in the United States-Mexico border region. These companies are able to take advantage of cheaper labor, favorable tax breaks, lax environmental regulations, and otherwise keep costs minimal while operating close to the core markets for the products. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Offshoring- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The practice of contracting with a third-party service provider in another country to take over or supervise part of the business operations. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<div class = "rapid-review">
<p><strong>Rapid Review: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industries are spatially distributed throughout the world in an uneven pattern. Four major areas--Eastern North America, East Asia, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe dominate, but China is rapidly becoming more important than these regions. Factors influencing the location of industries are based on costs, labor markets, and proximity to markets. Industrial location theories discuss how the location of each industry is determined and overall concerns with resource distribution, usage, and sustainability are increasingly of importance. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-7">Chapter 7: Cities And Urban Land Use</h2>
<div class = "summary">
<p><b>Summary:</b> Cities perform important functions in their societies. Most cities throughout the world are growing at a rapid pace that exceeds
population growth in their regions. Seventy-five percent of Americans now live in cities, and the 
proportion of Europeans, Russians, Australians, and Japanese who live in cities is almost as high. Even countries and regiosn with low urbanization
rates have cities of sizeable populations. World cities, megacities, and supercities all play important roles in their respective regions. This chapter reviews the main functions of cities and the relationships within the city itself and between the city and its surrounding
hinterland.</p>
</div>


<p><strong>-Hinterland- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A city&rsquo;s surrounding trade area. Urban influence zones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-All cities have a </span><strong>site </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or local setting, and a </span><strong>situation </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or regional setting, which evolve and change over time. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gateway Cities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Established worldwide as control centers for the colonial powers.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Urbanization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid growth of--and migration to--large cities. Today urbanization is taking place at a rapid rate in most LDCs.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Rural-To-Urban Migration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movement of people from the countryside to the city usually in search of economic opportunities (jobs) and a better life (both &ldquo;pull&rdquo; factors of migration). This increase in urban population causes rapid physical expansion of cities and greater urbanization of the society. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Supercity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very large city. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Megalopolis- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of super-cities that have merged together into one large urban area. </span></p>
<p><strong>-World City- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often called a global city. A city that serves as an important linkage or connection point in the global economic system. These cities serve as banking and finance world leaders and headquarters for multinational corporations (MNCs). They are also world communication and transportation hubs and have the most international political influence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Cities: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">London</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokyo</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paris</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sydney</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seoul</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Megacity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A metropolitan area with a total population of over 10 million people according to the UN.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Suburbanization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movement of people from urban core areas to surrounding the outer edges of the cities. Became a dynamic force in American society. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Edge Cities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">New urban complexes; self-sufficient suburbs; complete cities in themselves. Contain large nodes of office buildings and commercial operations with more workers than residents. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Primate City- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geographer Mark Jefferson theorized the primate city is at least twice as large as the next largest city in the country and more than twice as significant. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Rank-Size-Rule- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposed by Zif. States that if all cities in a country are placed in order from the largest to the smallest, the rate of decrease in size of each city&rsquo;s population is large at first but quickly slows. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Central Place Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by Geographer Walter Christaller. States that cities exist for economic reasons and that people gather together in cities to share goods and ideas. Therefore, the central place exists chiefly to provide goods and services to its surrounding population and functions as a distribution center. Christaller stated that humans will always purchase goods from the closest place that offers the good, and when a high demand for a certain good exists, the good will be offered in close proximity to the population. When demand drops, so does the availability of the good. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Threshold- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minimum number of people needed for a central place business or activity to thrive and stay prosperous. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gravity Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A law of spatial interaction based on Newton&rsquo;s law of gravity. It states that larger places attract people, ideas, and goods more strongly than smaller places. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Central Business District (CBD)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the center of every urban land use model. Is found at the center of every older central city and is the area of skyscrapers, business headquarters, large banks, and crowded streets. Fanning out from this intensive land use area is a fringe of wholesale and retail businesses, warehouses, bus and light rail terminals and light industry. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Concentric Zone Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by sociologist Ernest Burgess in the 1920s based on his studies of Chicago. This model is dynamic-as the city grows and expands, the inner rings invade the outer ones. This invasion and succession process occurs continually as the city grows and expands outward.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Bid Rent Curve- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burgess&rsquo;s model is based on the bid rent curve, which states that the concentric circles are based on the amount that people will pay for the land. The amount they will pay depends on the profits that are available from maintaining a business on that land. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Sector Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by the economist Homer Hoyt in 1939, in which urban growth creates a pie-shaped urban structure due, in large measure, to the improvement of transportation. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Multiple Nuclei Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by Chauncey Harris and Edward Ullman in 1945. They claimed the CBD was no longer the only nucleus of the urban area, but that other separate nuclei become specialized and differentiated. They concluded that the following attributes determine where these multiple nuclei, or nodes, are located:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differential accessibility. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesale activities require ports and railroad terminals while the retail sector requires maximum accessibility and parking.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Land use compatibility. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Centripetal forces operate based on economies of agglomeration. Some activities interact powerfully with one another such as banking and financial institutions.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Land use incompatibility. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some activities repel each other causing centrifugal forces to operate. Heavy industry repels high-end residential areas, for example.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Location suitability. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some activities must locate at a suboptimal location because of cost factors. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ways To Remember The Models:</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All cities in the developing world&hellip;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a large, vigorous informal economic sector</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receive large numbers of rural migrants</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Produce a major portion of their country&rsquo;s gross domestic income (GDI)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are surrounded by huge high-density areas of squatter settlements with few if any amenities. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other important things to remember about developing cities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colonial impact heavily influences many cities in former colonies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centrally planned land-use patterns influenced many Asian cities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forward capitals are new cities recently built to serve a growing and changing country.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities serving as religious centers are strongly influenced by religion.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional cities are crowded with a single major business district.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modernized cities take on Western characteristics (CBD, public transportation). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief purpose of the city governs land-use patterns (ports, industrial, mining center, markets). </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Basic Sector- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employs workers who produce goods and services for individuals outside the urban area.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Non-Basic Sector- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">produce goods and services for people employed within the urban area-to make it safer, healthier, and a better place to live and work. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Multiplier Effect- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can provide insight as to how many non-basic jobs are created by one basic job. Usually at least two non-basic jobs are created for every new basic job. Non-basic jobs also create more non-basic jobs because service workers also require services themselves. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Base Multiplier -</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">total employment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basic employment</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Uneven Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plagues US cities as some areas receive lots of investment dollars and other areas receive only token amounts.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Segregation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The physical separation of two groups of a population; in the US, it is usually based on race. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Urban Sprawl- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">After WWII, the system of housing development that became commonplace was based on the distinct separation of uses, rather than the creation of neighborhoods. This separate-use system has become known as urban sprawl or conventional suburban development (CSD). </span></p>
<p><strong>-Urban Renewal- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of identifying properties in inner-city neighborhoods that are then acquired, cleared of residents and structures, and then handed over to private investors or public agencies for construction of parks, schools, or new housing. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Public Housing- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government-constructed and regulated low-income housing. The US government no longer funds the construction of new public housing since the old structures are not maintained and have deteriorated into run-down, high-crime neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Gentrification- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process in which older neighborhoods near the city center are sometimes renovated by middle-class and higher-income families. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Congregation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different ethnic groups often group in specific parts of the city in a process called congregation. Minority groups based on ethnicity, religion, culture, or lifestyle live closer together to support each other and minimize conflict with non minority groups. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Ghettoization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concentration of a certain group of residents to a certain area against their will through either legal means or practices of social discrimination. </span></p>
<p><strong>-New Urbanism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An urban design movement that started in the US in the early 1980s and is very influential in urban planning today. The main emphasis of this urban design is a return to earlier neighborhoods and a sense of community. Reduce traffic congestion, increase affordable housing, stop urban sprawl, pedestrian-friendly, easy access of residential areas. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Green Building- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as green construction or sustainable building. The practice of building structure using materials and processes that are environmentally safe and resource-efficient throughout a building&rsquo;s lifecycle: design, construction, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. </span></p>

<div class = "rapid-review">
<p><strong>Rapid Review: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urbanization is a global occurrence with the majority of the world&rsquo;s population now living in cities. Eah city has specific functions to perform for its residents and surrounding hinterlands. City land use and social structures vary among regions of the world and even within a region sometimes. Several models help explain land-use patterns in the US. Cities in LDCs are growing in size so rapidly they are unable to provide housing, jobs, or social services for most of the new residents. </span></p>
