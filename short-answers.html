<p><b>1. Can you place your home within a certain region of the country? Which one(s)?<br />
Would people outside your area agree?<br />
What characteristics are used to make that regional classification?</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>My home would be within a functional region of the US. A functional (or nodal) region is a region of interdependent parts which operate 
together as an organizational unit, through their connectivity. It is characterized by having a core area, where features are most 
clearly depicted, and a margin, or periphery, where those features are blurred and lessened. The centers of these regions are usually 
located near trade areas, areas of national influence, and regional capitals, although these are subject to change. In my case, the 
core of my functional region would be Indianapolis, and my home would be within the region but not near the periphery, since the city 
of Carmel is located right next to Indianapolis. People outside my home state, however, might see my home as a formal region, in 
regards to similarity of law and administration throughout the whole state of Indiana.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>I think that the city of Carmel, IN, where I live, would best fit into the functional (also known as nodal) region. I imagine that 
outsiders would agree with me, seeing the way Carmel works. Everyone inside is very interdependent and organized, although the city 
itself is due to change. My city’s core resides in the Carmel City Center (the official downtown) where the attributes of the city 
are most aptly revealed to outsiders. That is, that Carmel skyrockets in the intellectual fields, attracting artists, sculptors, and 
actors all over the world. Unified in cultural sense but independent as successful people, Carmel would be a great fit as part of the 
functional region.</p>

<p><b>2. Hypothesize about how a GIS could be used to better understand something about your  community.<br />
What data layers would you want to include?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although I am now living in Indiana, my family and I will be moving to Ohio by the end of the year. Because they could not find 
	a suitable house to buy in Ohio, instead, my parents decided to buy a lot and build a house of our own. A GIS would be very 
	important to reference in the process of looking for a suitable lot to buy. We would want to include many different data layers 
	in our GIS, including terrain models, utilities, lots/ownership, and zones/districts. Since my parents do not like houses 
	located by lakes, rivers, or ponds, the terrain model data layer would help in eliminating those lots, and also lots with bumpy 
	and hilly land instead of flat, smooth terrain. The utilities data layer would also be very useful, as we try to avoid all 
	electricity poles and cellphone towers. The most important layer, however, would obviously be the lots/ownership data layer, 
	which is the one my parents would reference to the most. Finally, in order to find a lot situated near a good school district, 
	my parents would want to take a look at the zones/districts layer. Even though our family is home schooled, we have found that 
	houses located in good school districts tend to sell better. Having access to a GIS with all these data layers would 
	drastically reduce the amount of time and work spent on the process of building a house.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>When my family and I began considering a move to my city of Carmel, IN, we had to look many GIS data layers. For example, what 
	school district would we be in? Which educational facilities would be near us? And terrain models. Would we want to live near 
	fertile grass, lush forests, or huge lakes? <br />
	But I think that one of the most important GIS layers for us were lot and property lines. If we were to buy a house there, what 
	property would it be on? Which community and which lots would there be houses suitable for us? The first thing one has to 
	consider when moving is lots and property. <br />
	Wooded areas also played a big role, and it really helped me understand more about my community. Monon Trail, the famous, 
	renowned trail located in my city, is full of wooded areas, and I like to think that the place where I’m walking is a GIS 
	layer. It’s quite silly, I know, but very fun.</p>

<p><b>3. How many different types of maps can you identify? List them and describe each of these types of maps briefly.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>General-purpose, reference, and location maps are maps that show many different features of an area without analyzing or 
	interpreting any of those features. Examples of these types of maps may include atlases and highway maps. Thematic maps present 
	specific data from a single category. Thematic maps can be divided into two groups: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative 
	maps seek to show the distribution of a certain category of information, while quantitative maps show these characteristics in 
	numerical value. For example, a qualitative map would examine the distribution of parks across the US, while a quantitative map 
	would look at the number of park visitors each park had. Some types of quantitative maps include graduated circle, dot, 
	isopleth, isometric, and choropleth maps. Graduated circle maps use different sizes of circles to show the frequency of 
	happenings in an area. Dot maps use dots to show the number of occurrences, as well as the distribution of these occurrences 
	and their spatial pattern. Isometric maps use isolines to connect points of equal value, while isopleth maps use isolines to 
	show average values for areas. Finally, a choropleth map shows the average value of the data per areal unit, and uses different 
	shades of colors to convey different average values for each unit.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Thematic maps, graduated circle maps, dot maps, isometric maps, isopleth maps, and choropleth maps are the maps in this book 
	I could identify. Thematic maps are maps that show a graphic theme; in other words, they feature distribution or spatial data. 
	Graduated circle maps feature different sized circles that show how frequently a topic takes place in certain areas: if 
	frequently, the circles are bigger. If not as frequently, the circles are smaller. Dot maps are just what it sounds like: dots! 
	They are very similar to graduated circle maps, but each occurrence is marked by a dot. Isometric maps have lines that link 
	points together. These points register the same values of the thing that is mapped. Isopleth maps’ calculations does not allude 
	only to a point but also to a statistic. Choropleth maps are maps that give the average of the data presented.</p>

<p><b>4. What´s the difference between human geography and other social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, or sociology? Be 
	careful!  Think about the fact that Geography is a spatial science. In other words, geographers look at the world in terms of 
	space and place.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although all of these social sciences study how humans interact within societies, the key to understanding their differences 
	is in the way and the model they use to approach this topic. Human geography, as a systematic branch of geography, examines the 
	world from a spatial viewpoint. It´s focus is on the interaction and relationships of people over space and place.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>I think that human geography is different because-just as it’s name suggests-it is geographical. Psychology, anthropology, 
	and sociology all study <i>man</i>, how <i>man</i> works, and what <i>man</i> has in relation to each other. On the other hand, 
	human geography studies what man has in relation to the earth. What impact has he put? How did people concentrate in different 
	parts of the earth? How are they spatially distributed? What do people think of their communities? What are communities? Unlike 
	other social sciences, human geography seeks to answer these questions.</p>

<p><b>5. Describe the site and situation of the town where you live.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>The site of Carmel, IN features gently rolling hills, shallow valleys, and moderate temperatures.  It includes many hiking 
	trails (the Monon Trail being the most well-known), bike paths, natural parks and a bustling and vibrant Arts and 
	Designs District. Carmel is most prominently known as the "Roundabout City of the US," as it´s streets and 
	intersections feature a huge number of roundabouts (traffic circles).  The situation of Carmel is bounded on the 
	west by the White River, and located just north of Indianapolis, placing it in the Indianapolis metropolitan area 
	situated in Central Indiana.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>The site of my town, Carmel, IN, is smack in the middle of Indiana. It provides a moderate balance between the sloping hills 
	of Pennsylvania and the flat roads of Ohio. Although somewhat prone to tornadoes, Carmel is mainly oblivious to the many 
	natural catastrophes that provoke cities like New Orleans, having mild weather and being relatively cleanly and new.<br />
	The situation of Carmel is just above the great city of Indianapolis, making it a suburb. Sitting in the center of “the 
	crossroads of America,” it is a huge business/art hub and inspires many to make it their home. It borders Ohio on the right 
	and Illinois on the left, and was named Best City To Relocate To by the Money magazine in 2012.</p>

<p><b>1. Define "culture."</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>Culture is the specialized and habitual behavior patterns, attitudes, adaptations, and social systems that are transmitted in 
societies by imitation, instruction, and example. Individuals in these societies acquire integrated sets of behavioral, 
environmental, and social perceptions that summarize their learned way of life. Culture is formed through the way separate 
human groups develop different techniques to solve their regionally unique problems, thus creating areally distinctive customs 
and ways of life. </p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>Culture is the learned way of life that a specific people group follows, consisting of specialized behavioral patterns, social 
systems, adaptations, and understandings. Visible examples of such behavioral patterns is seen in language, clothing, government, 
ways of farming/building, and methods of earning a living. A number of different things segregate cultures and peoples (making them 
distinct), including difference in climate and ways/adoption of skill development.</p>

<p><b>2. If culture is learned, and not inherited (biological), then how is it transmitted to the younger generation?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Culture has nothing to do with natural instinct or genes, but is transmitted to younger generations through imitation, 
	instruction, and example. By interacting with and modeling the people in their specific social groups, these individuals 
	gradually acquire sets of behavior, environmental, and social patterns that are integrated into their own perceptions of the 
	world around them. As a result, they learn to adhere to these rules and expectations of not only the culture as a whole but 
	also of the distinctive subcultures to which they belong.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Culture is transmitted to the younger generation by means of imitation, instruction, and example. Children are taught from 
	a very young age their people’s way of life, and they imitate their parents in everything they do. In other words, the younger 
	generation follows the example of the older generation, from language to education to earning a living, until they are 
	themselves ready to transmit culture to the next generation; and so on. In this way, culture will indefinitely, though 
	discreetly, be preserved, and though culture is shaky and may alter over time, it will retain the same concepts and many 
	behavioral patterns.</p>

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Culture traits are the smallest, most distinctive units of the fundamental culture variables that give structure and spatial

<p><b>4. What is the name of the philosophy that states that one's environment shapes one's appearance, action, and thoughts? Why is it

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Environmental determinism is the belief that the environment, most notably its physical, climatic, and geographical 
	features, alone shape humans, their thoughts, and their actions. This idea has been long dismissed because of its 
	intellectually limiting and invalid claims. Environmental factors alone cannot account for the numerous cultural variations 
	we see around the world. Although the environment does place certain limitations on human use of territory, human choices are 
	also affected greatly by levels of technology, needs, traditions, and systems of organization. </p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Environmental determinism is the name of the philosophy that states that one’s environment exclusively shapes one’s 
	appearance, action, and thoughts. However, it is no longer considered viable, simply because many defining cultural traits,
	such as organizations, beliefs, and levels of technology, truly have nothing to do with one’s environment. Additionally, there

<h3 id = "quiz3">Fellmann Chapter 3 Quiz</h3>

<p><b>1. How is complementarity related to the global economy?</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>Complementarity is a flow-determining factor that affects spatial interaction. It is the circumstance in which one place supplies 
an item for which another place has an effective demand for. In other words, for two places to interact, it is not enough just to have 
a small difference in the commodity surplus or deficit of two places, but instead there needs to be an effective supply and demand. 
Complementarity is related to global economy, the international exchange of goods and services, in the sense that it helps pattern this 
movement of commodities. In both global economy and complementarity, supply and market come together to produce exchanges of raw and 
agricultural goods from less developed countries to developed countries, for the benefit of their more advanced industrial commodities.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>I think that complementarity is related to the global economy because without complementarity, global trade could never occur. 
For example, if America didn’t need coffee beans from Brazil, Brazil couldn’t trade coffee beans with America, since America didn’t 
need it. Similarly, if Brazil didn’t need machines and engines from America, America couldn’t trade with Brazil. Thus saying, each 
country would need to survive on only what they had, which can vary: making each country much more different than it needs to be. 
No complementarity will completely mess-up the global economy: making some countries tyrannical and demolishing others.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the idea that one place must have what another place wants and can secure.<br />

<p><b>2. How does the relevant friction of distance in our lives change as we age from childhood to adolescence to adulthood?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Friction of distance is a measure of how distance can have an effect on human interaction, and is controlled by the varying 
	penalties of time and money. Friction of distance influences the lives and actions of people everywhere, but can also be 
	influenced by age. For example, children have many limitations which may affect their friction of distance. They are unable 
	to drive, unable to walk by themselves over a long distance, and under the control of their parents, who decide where they are 
	supposed to go. As they grow into adolescence, teenagers begin to gain more responsibility of themselves, are less watched 
	over, and, as time progresses, even learn to drive. However, they are still under the authority of their parents, who have 
	the final call over decisions. This transition from childhood to adolescence somewhat alters the friction of distance in their 
	lives. Full responsibility occurs during adulthood, where adults take control over the actions and decisions they make in their 
	jobs, careers, and possibly their marriage. This stage is where the greatest change is made in their friction of distance.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Friction of distance actually relates to our travels more than we think. While as children in our early childhood we do not 
	have cars to drive, and our parents restrict the places we are to go. On the other hand, we are able to travel much more as we 
	advance into adolescence: having more opportunities, less restrictions, and better forms of transportation. As adults, our 
	friction of distance is even less limited, as we are able to drive, go to work, and shop. When we age further though, except 
	for repeated visits with our children, shopping, and other related activities, our friction of distance is much more retarded. 
</p>
</div> 
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the idea that a small child has a much smaller "world" in which to move while , as 
	we get older, we ride our bike, drive a car, and eventually overcome the friction of distance by our modes of transportation.</p>

<p><b>3. What do you think are the most important push and pull factors in the country today?<br />
Have they changed in the past 4-5 decades?<br />
How and why?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>America has always had a strong appeal to many immigrants from countries around the world. This may be because of America’s 
	many pull factors, most important of which include religious and political freedom, and economic opportunities. Many immigrants 
	come to America in order to escape or avoid religious persecution and corrupt government. In their minds, America has always 
	been a land of the free, where freedom, liberty, and equality are championed, and where intolerance of other races and cultures 
	is abhorred.  America also has an economic appeal to immigrants who were previously living in overpopulated regions with low 
	wages and limited job opportunities. To them, America promised "a better life" of ease. However, America does have push factors 
	as well. Although it is said to be a nation of equality, immigrants and citizens of different races do still experience social 
	prejudice and hostility. These factors have changed over time, along with the change of immigration rates. The developing 
	industrial state of America in the early 1900’s attracted people from all over the world to its urban cities. Immigration 
	rose and fell from then up until the start of the 21st century, when Mexican migrants came flooding into the US because of
	unemployment, poverty, and crime rates in their own country. This has changed some of the push factors in America, because of 
	tension between locals and migrants. Some citizens feel like the Mexican immigrants are becoming a threat to their society, and 
	there are also concerns that these immigrants are increasing crime rates, particularly in drug related crimes.  Lastly, the 
	political state of the government we are in right now may be pushing people out of the country.</p>

<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>As the textbook says, I think that family is one of the most important push factors, and economic growth is a critical pull 
	factor. After all, to support our families, we need a good job, reasonable housing, and optimal schooling. The inability to 
	support one’s family in one area will “push” the migrant out of that area, and the beckoning economic features of another 
	area will “pull” the migrant to live there. I wouldn’t say that the push factor has changed in the past 4-5 decades, but I 
	think that the pull factor has. Some cities have become richer and richer, drawing more migrants despite their climate-related 
	risks (i.e. New Orleans), while some are not as economically appealing and do not provide the best of job offers.</p>

<p><b>4. What is channelized migration?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Channelized migration shows channels that link areas which are connected by past migrations, economic trade considerations, 
	or some other factor. It is the tendency for migration to flow between certain areas that are socially or economically tied 
	together, without involving family or personal ties. Examples might include the migration of Asians to the West coast of the 
	US, or the migration of Irish people to the East coast.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Channelized migration is the “constant” of a migrant’s migration field, or, in other words, predictable, unchanging cycle of 
	migration the migrant follows. In the <i>Death In The Desert</i> video we watched this week, a map of Matias’s channelized migration 
	would show his constant route from hometown through desert across the border to California, and back. Basically, it is the flow 
	route of a migration field.</p>

<p><b>5. What is spatial interaction and what are the three main conditions that govern all spatial interaction?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Spatial interaction is the movement of people, ideas, and commodities, or goods that are bought or sold, within areas. 
	Spatial interaction is designed to produce effective integration of ideas or resources between different points of human 
	activity. It balances out and distributes all the different resources, commodities, and information from other countries. 
	Some examples of spatial interaction are international trade, telephone and cellphones, and radio broadcasts. The three main 
	flow-determining factors or principles controlling spatial interaction, proposed by geographer Edward Ullman, are 
	complementarity, transferability, and intervening opportunity. Complementarity refers to the need for an effective supply and 
	demand between two places. Transferability takes into account the costs of exchange or movement of a commmodity, and 
	intervening opportunity is the existence of more attractive sources of supply or demand which are closer and cheaper than 
	the original source.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Spatial interaction is the flow of people, trades, and other things between areas and within areas. It is the interaction 
	that people and goods have with each other. However, there are conditions that govern how we spatially interact. Actually, 
	there are three main conditions that govern spatial interaction, thought of by geographer Edward Ullman. The first is 
	complementarity, which defines that a group must have something that another is in need of, the second is transferability, 
	the time, cost, and effort factors, and the third is intervening opportunity, the rule that complementarity can be effective 
	only if there are no closer and cheaper sources at hand (taking transferability into mind).</p>
