<p><b>1. Can you place your home within a certain region of the country? Which one(s)?<br />
Would people outside your area agree?<br />
What characteristics are used to make that regional classification?</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>My home would be within a functional region of the US. A functional (or nodal) region is a region of interdependent parts which operate 
together as an organizational unit, through their connectivity. It is characterized by having a core area, where features are most 
clearly depicted, and a margin, or periphery, where those features are blurred and lessened. The centers of these regions are usually 
located near trade areas, areas of national influence, and regional capitals, although these are subject to change. In my case, the 
core of my functional region would be Indianapolis, and my home would be within the region but not near the periphery, since the city 
of Carmel is located right next to Indianapolis. People outside my home state, however, might see my home as a formal region, in 
regards to similarity of law and administration throughout the whole state of Indiana.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>I think that the city of Carmel, IN, where I live, would best fit into the functional (also known as nodal) region. I imagine that 
outsiders would agree with me, seeing the way Carmel works. Everyone inside is very interdependent and organized, although the city 
itself is due to change. My city’s core resides in the Carmel City Center (the official downtown) where the attributes of the city 
are most aptly revealed to outsiders. That is, that Carmel skyrockets in the intellectual fields, attracting artists, sculptors, and 
actors all over the world. Unified in cultural sense but independent as successful people, Carmel would be a great fit as part of the 
functional region.</p>

<p><b>2. Hypothesize about how a GIS could be used to better understand something about your  community.<br />
What data layers would you want to include?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although I am now living in Indiana, my family and I will be moving to Ohio by the end of the year. Because they could not find 
	a suitable house to buy in Ohio, instead, my parents decided to buy a lot and build a house of our own. A GIS would be very 
	important to reference in the process of looking for a suitable lot to buy. We would want to include many different data layers 
	in our GIS, including terrain models, utilities, lots/ownership, and zones/districts. Since my parents do not like houses 
	located by lakes, rivers, or ponds, the terrain model data layer would help in eliminating those lots, and also lots with bumpy 
	and hilly land instead of flat, smooth terrain. The utilities data layer would also be very useful, as we try to avoid all 
	electricity poles and cellphone towers. The most important layer, however, would obviously be the lots/ownership data layer, 
	which is the one my parents would reference to the most. Finally, in order to find a lot situated near a good school district, 
	my parents would want to take a look at the zones/districts layer. Even though our family is home schooled, we have found that 
	houses located in good school districts tend to sell better. Having access to a GIS with all these data layers would 
	drastically reduce the amount of time and work spent on the process of building a house.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>When my family and I began considering a move to my city of Carmel, IN, we had to look many GIS data layers. For example, what 
	school district would we be in? Which educational facilities would be near us? And terrain models. Would we want to live near 
	fertile grass, lush forests, or huge lakes? <br />
	But I think that one of the most important GIS layers for us were lot and property lines. If we were to buy a house there, what 
	property would it be on? Which community and which lots would there be houses suitable for us? The first thing one has to 
	consider when moving is lots and property. <br />
	Wooded areas also played a big role, and it really helped me understand more about my community. Monon Trail, the famous, 
	renowned trail located in my city, is full of wooded areas, and I like to think that the place where I’m walking is a GIS 
	layer. It’s quite silly, I know, but very fun.</p>
</div> 
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Give yourself credit if you  answered both questions by including the information on page 24, Figure 1.24.</p>
</div>
	
	<br /><br />

<p><b>3. How many different types of maps can you identify? List them and describe each of these types of maps briefly.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>General-purpose, reference, and location maps are maps that show many different features of an area without analyzing or 
	interpreting any of those features. Examples of these types of maps may include atlases and highway maps. Thematic maps present 
	specific data from a single category. Thematic maps can be divided into two groups: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative 
	maps seek to show the distribution of a certain category of information, while quantitative maps show these characteristics in 
	numerical value. For example, a qualitative map would examine the distribution of parks across the US, while a quantitative map 
	would look at the number of park visitors each park had. Some types of quantitative maps include graduated circle, dot, 
	isopleth, isometric, and choropleth maps. Graduated circle maps use different sizes of circles to show the frequency of 
	happenings in an area. Dot maps use dots to show the number of occurrences, as well as the distribution of these occurrences 
	and their spatial pattern. Isometric maps use isolines to connect points of equal value, while isopleth maps use isolines to 
	show average values for areas. Finally, a choropleth map shows the average value of the data per areal unit, and uses different 
	shades of colors to convey different average values for each unit.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Thematic maps, graduated circle maps, dot maps, isometric maps, isopleth maps, and choropleth maps are the maps in this book 
	I could identify. Thematic maps are maps that show a graphic theme; in other words, they feature distribution or spatial data. 
	Graduated circle maps feature different sized circles that show how frequently a topic takes place in certain areas: if 
	frequently, the circles are bigger. If not as frequently, the circles are smaller. Dot maps are just what it sounds like: dots! 
	They are very similar to graduated circle maps, but each occurrence is marked by a dot. Isometric maps have lines that link 
	points together. These points register the same values of the thing that is mapped. Isopleth maps’ calculations does not allude 
	only to a point but also to a statistic. Choropleth maps are maps that give the average of the data presented.</p>

	<p>Give yourself credit if you listed at list 3 types of maps and discuss each briefly.</p>

<p><b>4. What´s the difference between human geography and other social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, or sociology? Be 
	careful!  Think about the fact that Geography is a spatial science. In other words, geographers look at the world in terms of 
	space and place.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although all of these social sciences study how humans interact within societies, the key to understanding their differences 
	is in the way and the model they use to approach this topic. Human geography, as a systematic branch of geography, examines the 
	world from a spatial viewpoint. It´s focus is on the interaction and relationships of people over space and place.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>I think that human geography is different because-just as it’s name suggests-it is geographical. Psychology, anthropology, 
	and sociology all study <i>man</i>, how <i>man</i> works, and what <i>man</i> has in relation to each other. On the other hand, 
	human geography studies what man has in relation to the earth. What impact has he put? How did people concentrate in different 
	parts of the earth? How are they spatially distributed? What do people think of their communities? What are communities? Unlike 
	other social sciences, human geography seeks to answer these questions.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Give yourself credit for your answer if it included the words: spatial, space, and/or systems.</p>

	<br /><br />
	
	
<p><b>5. Describe the site and situation of the town where you live.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>The site of Carmel, IN features gently rolling hills, shallow valleys, and moderate temperatures.  It includes many hiking 
	trails (the Monon Trail being the most well-known), bike paths, natural parks and a bustling and vibrant Arts and 
	Designs District. Carmel is most prominently known as the "Roundabout City of the US," as it´s streets and 
	intersections feature a huge number of roundabouts (traffic circles).  The situation of Carmel is bounded on the 
	west by the White River, and located just north of Indianapolis, placing it in the Indianapolis metropolitan area 
	situated in Central Indiana.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>The site of my town, Carmel, IN, is smack in the middle of Indiana. It provides a moderate balance between the sloping hills 
	of Pennsylvania and the flat roads of Ohio. Although somewhat prone to tornadoes, Carmel is mainly oblivious to the many 
	natural catastrophes that provoke cities like New Orleans, having mild weather and being relatively cleanly and new.<br />
	The situation of Carmel is just above the great city of Indianapolis, making it a suburb. Sitting in the center of “the 
	crossroads of America,” it is a huge business/art hub and inspires many to make it their home. It borders Ohio on the right 
	and Illinois on the left, and was named Best City To Relocate To by the Money magazine in 2012.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>There is no correct answer but your description should include:<br />

	site - include the physical and cultural characteristics of your town and could also be absolute location as in coordinates of 
	latitude and longitude<br />

	situation - external relations of your town in reference to other locations - see page 8 of textbook for examples</p>
