<h3 id = "quiz1">Fellmann Chapter 1 Quiz</h3>

<p><b>1. Can you place your home within a certain region of the country? Which one(s)?<br />
Would people outside your area agree?<br />
What characteristics are used to make that regional classification?</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>My home would be within a functional region of the US. A functional (or nodal) region is a region of interdependent parts which operate 
together as an organizational unit, through their connectivity. It is characterized by having a core area, where features are most 
clearly depicted, and a margin, or periphery, where those features are blurred and lessened. The centers of these regions are usually 
located near trade areas, areas of national influence, and regional capitals, although these are subject to change. In my case, the 
core of my functional region would be Indianapolis, and my home would be within the region but not near the periphery, since the city 
of Carmel is located right next to Indianapolis. People outside my home state, however, might see my home as a formal region, in 
regards to similarity of law and administration throughout the whole state of Indiana.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>I think that the city of Carmel, IN, where I live, would best fit into the functional (also known as nodal) region. I imagine that 
outsiders would agree with me, seeing the way Carmel works. Everyone inside is very interdependent and organized, although the city 
itself is due to change. My city’s core resides in the Carmel City Center (the official downtown) where the attributes of the city 
are most aptly revealed to outsiders. That is, that Carmel skyrockets in the intellectual fields, attracting artists, sculptors, and 
actors all over the world. Unified in cultural sense but independent as successful people, Carmel would be a great fit as part of the 
functional region.</p>

<p><b>2. Hypothesize about how a GIS could be used to better understand something about your  community.<br />
What data layers would you want to include?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although I am now living in Indiana, my family and I will be moving to Ohio by the end of the year. Because they could not find 
	a suitable house to buy in Ohio, instead, my parents decided to buy a lot and build a house of our own. A GIS would be very 
	important to reference in the process of looking for a suitable lot to buy. We would want to include many different data layers 
	in our GIS, including terrain models, utilities, lots/ownership, and zones/districts. Since my parents do not like houses 
	located by lakes, rivers, or ponds, the terrain model data layer would help in eliminating those lots, and also lots with bumpy 
	and hilly land instead of flat, smooth terrain. The utilities data layer would also be very useful, as we try to avoid all 
	electricity poles and cellphone towers. The most important layer, however, would obviously be the lots/ownership data layer, 
	which is the one my parents would reference to the most. Finally, in order to find a lot situated near a good school district, 
	my parents would want to take a look at the zones/districts layer. Even though our family is home schooled, we have found that 
	houses located in good school districts tend to sell better. Having access to a GIS with all these data layers would 
	drastically reduce the amount of time and work spent on the process of building a house.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>When my family and I began considering a move to my city of Carmel, IN, we had to look many GIS data layers. For example, what 
	school district would we be in? Which educational facilities would be near us? And terrain models. Would we want to live near 
	fertile grass, lush forests, or huge lakes? <br />
	But I think that one of the most important GIS layers for us were lot and property lines. If we were to buy a house there, what 
	property would it be on? Which community and which lots would there be houses suitable for us? The first thing one has to 
	consider when moving is lots and property. <br />
	Wooded areas also played a big role, and it really helped me understand more about my community. Monon Trail, the famous, 
	renowned trail located in my city, is full of wooded areas, and I like to think that the place where I’m walking is a GIS 
	layer. It’s quite silly, I know, but very fun.</p>

<p><b>3. How many different types of maps can you identify? List them and describe each of these types of maps briefly.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>General-purpose, reference, and location maps are maps that show many different features of an area without analyzing or 
	interpreting any of those features. Examples of these types of maps may include atlases and highway maps. Thematic maps present 
	specific data from a single category. Thematic maps can be divided into two groups: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative 
	maps seek to show the distribution of a certain category of information, while quantitative maps show these characteristics in 
	numerical value. For example, a qualitative map would examine the distribution of parks across the US, while a quantitative map 
	would look at the number of park visitors each park had. Some types of quantitative maps include graduated circle, dot, 
	isopleth, isometric, and choropleth maps. Graduated circle maps use different sizes of circles to show the frequency of 
	happenings in an area. Dot maps use dots to show the number of occurrences, as well as the distribution of these occurrences 
	and their spatial pattern. Isometric maps use isolines to connect points of equal value, while isopleth maps use isolines to 
	show average values for areas. Finally, a choropleth map shows the average value of the data per areal unit, and uses different 
	shades of colors to convey different average values for each unit.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Thematic maps, graduated circle maps, dot maps, isometric maps, isopleth maps, and choropleth maps are the maps in this book 
	I could identify. Thematic maps are maps that show a graphic theme; in other words, they feature distribution or spatial data. 
	Graduated circle maps feature different sized circles that show how frequently a topic takes place in certain areas: if 
	frequently, the circles are bigger. If not as frequently, the circles are smaller. Dot maps are just what it sounds like: dots! 
	They are very similar to graduated circle maps, but each occurrence is marked by a dot. Isometric maps have lines that link 
	points together. These points register the same values of the thing that is mapped. Isopleth maps’ calculations does not allude 
	only to a point but also to a statistic. Choropleth maps are maps that give the average of the data presented.</p>

<p><b>4. What´s the difference between human geography and other social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, or sociology? Be 
	careful!  Think about the fact that Geography is a spatial science. In other words, geographers look at the world in terms of 
	space and place.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although all of these social sciences study how humans interact within societies, the key to understanding their differences 
	is in the way and the model they use to approach this topic. Human geography, as a systematic branch of geography, examines the 
	world from a spatial viewpoint. It´s focus is on the interaction and relationships of people over space and place.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>I think that human geography is different because-just as it’s name suggests-it is geographical. Psychology, anthropology, 
	and sociology all study <i>man</i>, how <i>man</i> works, and what <i>man</i> has in relation to each other. On the other hand, 
	human geography studies what man has in relation to the earth. What impact has he put? How did people concentrate in different 
	parts of the earth? How are they spatially distributed? What do people think of their communities? What are communities? Unlike 
	other social sciences, human geography seeks to answer these questions.</p>

<p><b>5. Describe the site and situation of the town where you live.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>The site of Carmel, IN features gently rolling hills, shallow valleys, and moderate temperatures.  It includes many hiking 
	trails (the Monon Trail being the most well-known), bike paths, natural parks and a bustling and vibrant Arts and 
	Designs District. Carmel is most prominently known as the "Roundabout City of the US," as it´s streets and 
	intersections feature a huge number of roundabouts (traffic circles).  The situation of Carmel is bounded on the 
	west by the White River, and located just north of Indianapolis, placing it in the Indianapolis metropolitan area 
	situated in Central Indiana.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>The site of my town, Carmel, IN, is smack in the middle of Indiana. It provides a moderate balance between the sloping hills 
	of Pennsylvania and the flat roads of Ohio. Although somewhat prone to tornadoes, Carmel is mainly oblivious to the many 
	natural catastrophes that provoke cities like New Orleans, having mild weather and being relatively cleanly and new.<br />
	The situation of Carmel is just above the great city of Indianapolis, making it a suburb. Sitting in the center of “the 
	crossroads of America,” it is a huge business/art hub and inspires many to make it their home. It borders Ohio on the right 
	and Illinois on the left, and was named Best City To Relocate To by the Money magazine in 2012.</p>

<p><b>1. Define "culture."</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>Culture is the specialized and habitual behavior patterns, attitudes, adaptations, and social systems that are transmitted in 
societies by imitation, instruction, and example. Individuals in these societies acquire integrated sets of behavioral, 
environmental, and social perceptions that summarize their learned way of life. Culture is formed through the way separate 
human groups develop different techniques to solve their regionally unique problems, thus creating areally distinctive customs 
and ways of life. </p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>Culture is the learned way of life that a specific people group follows, consisting of specialized behavioral patterns, social 
systems, adaptations, and understandings. Visible examples of such behavioral patterns is seen in language, clothing, government, 
ways of farming/building, and methods of earning a living. A number of different things segregate cultures and peoples (making them 
distinct), including difference in climate and ways/adoption of skill development.</p>

<p><b>2. If culture is learned, and not inherited (biological), then how is it transmitted to the younger generation?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Culture has nothing to do with natural instinct or genes, but is transmitted to younger generations through imitation, 
	instruction, and example. By interacting with and modeling the people in their specific social groups, these individuals 
	gradually acquire sets of behavior, environmental, and social patterns that are integrated into their own perceptions of the 
	world around them. As a result, they learn to adhere to these rules and expectations of not only the culture as a whole but 
	also of the distinctive subcultures to which they belong.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Culture is transmitted to the younger generation by means of imitation, instruction, and example. Children are taught from 
	a very young age their people’s way of life, and they imitate their parents in everything they do. In other words, the younger 
	generation follows the example of the older generation, from language to education to earning a living, until they are 
	themselves ready to transmit culture to the next generation; and so on. In this way, culture will indefinitely, though 
	discreetly, be preserved, and though culture is shaky and may alter over time, it will retain the same concepts and many 
	behavioral patterns.</p>

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Culture traits are the smallest, most distinctive units of the fundamental culture variables that give structure and spatial

<p><b>4. What is the name of the philosophy that states that one's environment shapes one's appearance, action, and thoughts? Why is it 
	no longer considered viable?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Environmental determinism is the belief that the environment, most notably its physical, climatic, and geographical 
	features, alone shape humans, their thoughts, and their actions. This idea has been long dismissed because of its 
	intellectually limiting and invalid claims. Environmental factors alone cannot account for the numerous cultural variations 
	we see around the world. Although the environment does place certain limitations on human use of territory, human choices are 
	also affected greatly by levels of technology, needs, traditions, and systems of organization. </p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Environmental determinism is the name of the philosophy that states that one’s environment exclusively shapes one’s 
	appearance, action, and thoughts. However, it is no longer considered viable, simply because many defining cultural traits,
	such as organizations, beliefs, and levels of technology, truly have nothing to do with one’s environment. Additionally, there

<p><b>5. Define the cultural landscape.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">

<p><b>6. What does innovation within a culture bring to that culture?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Innovation, which is caused by ideas created within and adopted by a social group, results in both major and minor cultural 
	changes. Although many innovations are of little consequence by themselves, the widespread adoption of these innovations can

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>If I am correct in assuming that Christianity was first introduced to Mesoamerica by the Spanish Conquistadors, this would 
	have been an example of relocation diffusion. In relocation diffusion, the innovation or idea is physically carried to a new

	Catholic faith, which they tried to force upon the native Aztec people.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Expansion diffusion would probably be the type of diffusion represented in the example of the introduction of Christianity 
	to the Mesoamerican people. The Spanish explorers who settled Mesoamerica took Christianity with them, and although they were

<p><b>8. Voodoo and santeria are examples of what cultural fusion process?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Voodoo and santeria are both examples of syncretism, which is the process of the fusion of the old and new. In this major 
	feature of cultural change, adopting cultures do not accept intact items originating outside the receiving society, but instead 
	alter its meaning or form in order to make it acceptable to its own culture. Slaves first brought voodoo from West Africa to 
	the America’s, where over time, it absorbed influence from French, Spanish, and American Indian religious traditions. These 
	adaptive mixings were all made to suit the faiths and practices of different religious groups.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Voodoo and santeria would be good examples of the cultural fusion process of syncretism. Slaves brought voodoo from West 
	Africa to the Americas where it thrived in the southernmost states/countries. Over the years, it was then influenced by other 
	people groups and religions. Because of this, many believers see no contradiction between Christianity and voodoo; syncretism 
	is reflected in both obvious and discrete alterations of certain things to suit the needs of it’s people.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the word Syncretism.<br />
	Syncretism is the merging of beliefs of two different items, such as religions, into a new form. In voodoo and santeria, 
	traditional animistic religions are mixed with Roman Catholicism to create a folk religion that is a blend of elements of both 
	religions. In food, Tex-Mex is clearly not either Texan (U.S) or Mexican cuisine but rather an interesting (and tasty) merging 
	of both!</p>

<p><b>9. What is included in the concept of culture?<br />
How is culture transmitted?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Culture is a complex web of behaviors and attitudes, and understanding it fully is impossible for one who is not part of the 
	culture. However, for analytical purposes, the traits and building blocks of culture can be grouped into a three-part structure 
	composed of ideological, technological, and sociological subsets. The ideological subsystem includes the ideas, beliefs, and 
	knowledge of a culture that are expressed in speech or other forms of communication. These abstract belief systems, such as 
	theologies, legends, literature, and philosophy, are known as mentifacts, and tell us what we ought to believe and value, and 
	how we ought to act. The technological subsystem consists of the material objects and techniques which people use to live their 
	everyday lives. These artifacts are tools which enable us to feed, clothe, amuse, transport, and defend ourselves. The last 
	subsystem, the sociological subsystem, lays out the expected and accepted patterns of interpersonal relations in economic, 
	political, military, religious, and kinship associations. These learned patterns of behavior, called sociofacts, regulate 
	how an individual functions in a group and defines the social organization of a culture.<br />
	Ideas and innovations of a culture are transmitted through diffusion, which assumes two main processes: expansion diffusion and 
	relocation diffusion. Expansion diffusion occurs when an item or idea is diffused, or spread from one place to the other, 
	usually aided by local and mass media. In expansion diffusion, the object or idea being diffused is frequently intensified in 
	the origin area. Expansion diffusion includes contagious, hierarchical, and stimulus diffusion. Relocation diffusion involves 
	the physical spread of an innovation or idea by migrating individuals that possess it. An example of relocation diffusion is 
	the spread of religions by settlers or conquerer migrating to a new locale.</p>

	<p>Culture can be viewed as divided into three subsets: the ideological, technological, and sociological subsystems.
	The ideological subsystem includes ideas, beliefs, and mentality of a culture, known as mentifacts. The technological
	subsystem includes physical and material things that enable them to live their everyday life, which include food,
	clothing, amusement, and transportation methods. Finally, the sociological subsystem is composed of sociofacts: 
	learned patterns of behavior such as political, religious, military, economic, and kinship associations.<br />
	Culture is transmitted through the method of imitation, instruction, and example; it is not diffused through genes.
	Children learn culture by imitating their parents, and learning the cultural values of their society in schools,
	churches, and more.</p>

	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the words or ideas:<br />
	specialized patterns of behavior, adaptations, social systems,  etc. as seen in architecture, language, political organization, 
	language, religion, jobs, etc.<br />
	culture is transmitted through families and social groups such as communities, schools, churches, etc.  and is learned -  not 
	something you are born with.<br />
	Imitation, instruction, example</p>
