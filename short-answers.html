<p><b>1. Can you place your home within a certain region of the country? Which one(s)?<br />
Would people outside your area agree?<br />
What characteristics are used to make that regional classification?</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>My home would be within a functional region of the US. A functional (or nodal) region is a region of interdependent parts which operate 
together as an organizational unit, through their connectivity. It is characterized by having a core area, where features are most 
clearly depicted, and a margin, or periphery, where those features are blurred and lessened. The centers of these regions are usually 
located near trade areas, areas of national influence, and regional capitals, although these are subject to change. In my case, the 
core of my functional region would be Indianapolis, and my home would be within the region but not near the periphery, since the city 
of Carmel is located right next to Indianapolis. People outside my home state, however, might see my home as a formal region, in 
regards to similarity of law and administration throughout the whole state of Indiana.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>I think that the city of Carmel, IN, where I live, would best fit into the functional (also known as nodal) region. I imagine that 
outsiders would agree with me, seeing the way Carmel works. Everyone inside is very interdependent and organized, although the city 
itself is due to change. My city’s core resides in the Carmel City Center (the official downtown) where the attributes of the city 
are most aptly revealed to outsiders. That is, that Carmel skyrockets in the intellectual fields, attracting artists, sculptors, and 
actors all over the world. Unified in cultural sense but independent as successful people, Carmel would be a great fit as part of the 
functional region.</p>

<p><b>2. Hypothesize about how a GIS could be used to better understand something about your  community.<br />
What data layers would you want to include?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although I am now living in Indiana, my family and I will be moving to Ohio by the end of the year. Because they could not find 
	a suitable house to buy in Ohio, instead, my parents decided to buy a lot and build a house of our own. A GIS would be very 
	important to reference in the process of looking for a suitable lot to buy. We would want to include many different data layers 
	in our GIS, including terrain models, utilities, lots/ownership, and zones/districts. Since my parents do not like houses 
	located by lakes, rivers, or ponds, the terrain model data layer would help in eliminating those lots, and also lots with bumpy 
	and hilly land instead of flat, smooth terrain. The utilities data layer would also be very useful, as we try to avoid all 
	electricity poles and cellphone towers. The most important layer, however, would obviously be the lots/ownership data layer, 
	which is the one my parents would reference to the most. Finally, in order to find a lot situated near a good school district, 
	my parents would want to take a look at the zones/districts layer. Even though our family is home schooled, we have found that 
	houses located in good school districts tend to sell better. Having access to a GIS with all these data layers would 
	drastically reduce the amount of time and work spent on the process of building a house.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>When my family and I began considering a move to my city of Carmel, IN, we had to look many GIS data layers. For example, what 
	school district would we be in? Which educational facilities would be near us? And terrain models. Would we want to live near 
	fertile grass, lush forests, or huge lakes? <br />
	But I think that one of the most important GIS layers for us were lot and property lines. If we were to buy a house there, what 
	property would it be on? Which community and which lots would there be houses suitable for us? The first thing one has to 
	consider when moving is lots and property. <br />
	Wooded areas also played a big role, and it really helped me understand more about my community. Monon Trail, the famous, 
	renowned trail located in my city, is full of wooded areas, and I like to think that the place where I’m walking is a GIS 
	layer. It’s quite silly, I know, but very fun.</p>

<p><b>3. How many different types of maps can you identify? List them and describe each of these types of maps briefly.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>General-purpose, reference, and location maps are maps that show many different features of an area without analyzing or 
	interpreting any of those features. Examples of these types of maps may include atlases and highway maps. Thematic maps present 
	specific data from a single category. Thematic maps can be divided into two groups: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative 
	maps seek to show the distribution of a certain category of information, while quantitative maps show these characteristics in 
	numerical value. For example, a qualitative map would examine the distribution of parks across the US, while a quantitative map 
	would look at the number of park visitors each park had. Some types of quantitative maps include graduated circle, dot, 
	isopleth, isometric, and choropleth maps. Graduated circle maps use different sizes of circles to show the frequency of 
	happenings in an area. Dot maps use dots to show the number of occurrences, as well as the distribution of these occurrences 
	and their spatial pattern. Isometric maps use isolines to connect points of equal value, while isopleth maps use isolines to 
	show average values for areas. Finally, a choropleth map shows the average value of the data per areal unit, and uses different 
	shades of colors to convey different average values for each unit.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Thematic maps, graduated circle maps, dot maps, isometric maps, isopleth maps, and choropleth maps are the maps in this book 
	I could identify. Thematic maps are maps that show a graphic theme; in other words, they feature distribution or spatial data. 
	Graduated circle maps feature different sized circles that show how frequently a topic takes place in certain areas: if 
	frequently, the circles are bigger. If not as frequently, the circles are smaller. Dot maps are just what it sounds like: dots! 
	They are very similar to graduated circle maps, but each occurrence is marked by a dot. Isometric maps have lines that link 
	points together. These points register the same values of the thing that is mapped. Isopleth maps’ calculations does not allude 
	only to a point but also to a statistic. Choropleth maps are maps that give the average of the data presented.</p>

<p><b>4. What´s the difference between human geography and other social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, or sociology? Be 
	careful!  Think about the fact that Geography is a spatial science. In other words, geographers look at the world in terms of 
	space and place.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Although all of these social sciences study how humans interact within societies, the key to understanding their differences 
	is in the way and the model they use to approach this topic. Human geography, as a systematic branch of geography, examines the 
	world from a spatial viewpoint. It´s focus is on the interaction and relationships of people over space and place.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>I think that human geography is different because-just as it’s name suggests-it is geographical. Psychology, anthropology, 
	and sociology all study <i>man</i>, how <i>man</i> works, and what <i>man</i> has in relation to each other. On the other hand, 
	human geography studies what man has in relation to the earth. What impact has he put? How did people concentrate in different 
	parts of the earth? How are they spatially distributed? What do people think of their communities? What are communities? Unlike 
	other social sciences, human geography seeks to answer these questions.</p>

<p><b>5. Describe the site and situation of the town where you live.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>The site of Carmel, IN features gently rolling hills, shallow valleys, and moderate temperatures.  It includes many hiking 
	trails (the Monon Trail being the most well-known), bike paths, natural parks and a bustling and vibrant Arts and 
	Designs District. Carmel is most prominently known as the "Roundabout City of the US," as it´s streets and 
	intersections feature a huge number of roundabouts (traffic circles).  The situation of Carmel is bounded on the 
	west by the White River, and located just north of Indianapolis, placing it in the Indianapolis metropolitan area 
	situated in Central Indiana.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>The site of my town, Carmel, IN, is smack in the middle of Indiana. It provides a moderate balance between the sloping hills 
	of Pennsylvania and the flat roads of Ohio. Although somewhat prone to tornadoes, Carmel is mainly oblivious to the many 
	natural catastrophes that provoke cities like New Orleans, having mild weather and being relatively cleanly and new.<br />
	The situation of Carmel is just above the great city of Indianapolis, making it a suburb. Sitting in the center of “the 
	crossroads of America,” it is a huge business/art hub and inspires many to make it their home. It borders Ohio on the right 
	and Illinois on the left, and was named Best City To Relocate To by the Money magazine in 2012.</p>

<p><b>1. Define "culture."</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>Culture is the specialized and habitual behavior patterns, attitudes, adaptations, and social systems that are transmitted in 
societies by imitation, instruction, and example. Individuals in these societies acquire integrated sets of behavioral, 
environmental, and social perceptions that summarize their learned way of life. Culture is formed through the way separate 
human groups develop different techniques to solve their regionally unique problems, thus creating areally distinctive customs 
and ways of life. </p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>Culture is the learned way of life that a specific people group follows, consisting of specialized behavioral patterns, social 
systems, adaptations, and understandings. Visible examples of such behavioral patterns is seen in language, clothing, government, 
ways of farming/building, and methods of earning a living. A number of different things segregate cultures and peoples (making them 
distinct), including difference in climate and ways/adoption of skill development.</p>

<p><b>2. If culture is learned, and not inherited (biological), then how is it transmitted to the younger generation?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Culture has nothing to do with natural instinct or genes, but is transmitted to younger generations through imitation, 
	instruction, and example. By interacting with and modeling the people in their specific social groups, these individuals 
	gradually acquire sets of behavior, environmental, and social patterns that are integrated into their own perceptions of the 
	world around them. As a result, they learn to adhere to these rules and expectations of not only the culture as a whole but 
	also of the distinctive subcultures to which they belong.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Culture is transmitted to the younger generation by means of imitation, instruction, and example. Children are taught from 
	a very young age their people’s way of life, and they imitate their parents in everything they do. In other words, the younger 
	generation follows the example of the older generation, from language to education to earning a living, until they are 
	themselves ready to transmit culture to the next generation; and so on. In this way, culture will indefinitely, though 
	discreetly, be preserved, and though culture is shaky and may alter over time, it will retain the same concepts and many 
	behavioral patterns.</p>

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Culture traits are the smallest, most distinctive units of the fundamental culture variables that give structure and spatial

<p><b>4. What is the name of the philosophy that states that one's environment shapes one's appearance, action, and thoughts? Why is it

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Environmental determinism is the belief that the environment, most notably its physical, climatic, and geographical 
	features, alone shape humans, their thoughts, and their actions. This idea has been long dismissed because of its 
	intellectually limiting and invalid claims. Environmental factors alone cannot account for the numerous cultural variations 
	we see around the world. Although the environment does place certain limitations on human use of territory, human choices are 
	also affected greatly by levels of technology, needs, traditions, and systems of organization. </p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Environmental determinism is the name of the philosophy that states that one’s environment exclusively shapes one’s 
	appearance, action, and thoughts. However, it is no longer considered viable, simply because many defining cultural traits,
	such as organizations, beliefs, and levels of technology, truly have nothing to do with one’s environment. Additionally, there

<h3 id = "quiz3">Fellmann Chapter 3 Quiz</h3>

<p><b>1. How is complementarity related to the global economy?</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>Complementarity is a flow-determining factor that affects spatial interaction. It is the circumstance in which one place supplies 
an item for which another place has an effective demand for. In other words, for two places to interact, it is not enough just to have 
a small difference in the commodity surplus or deficit of two places, but instead there needs to be an effective supply and demand. 
Complementarity is related to global economy, the international exchange of goods and services, in the sense that it helps pattern this 
movement of commodities. In both global economy and complementarity, supply and market come together to produce exchanges of raw and 
agricultural goods from less developed countries to developed countries, for the benefit of their more advanced industrial commodities.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>I think that complementarity is related to the global economy because without complementarity, global trade could never occur. 
For example, if America didn’t need coffee beans from Brazil, Brazil couldn’t trade coffee beans with America, since America didn’t 
need it. Similarly, if Brazil didn’t need machines and engines from America, America couldn’t trade with Brazil. Thus saying, each 
country would need to survive on only what they had, which can vary: making each country much more different than it needs to be. 
No complementarity will completely mess-up the global economy: making some countries tyrannical and demolishing others.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the idea that one place must have what another place wants and can secure.<br />

<p><b>2. How does the relevant friction of distance in our lives change as we age from childhood to adolescence to adulthood?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Friction of distance is a measure of how distance can have an effect on human interaction, and is controlled by the varying 
	penalties of time and money. Friction of distance influences the lives and actions of people everywhere, but can also be 
	influenced by age. For example, children have many limitations which may affect their friction of distance. They are unable 
	to drive, unable to walk by themselves over a long distance, and under the control of their parents, who decide where they are 
	supposed to go. As they grow into adolescence, teenagers begin to gain more responsibility of themselves, are less watched 
	over, and, as time progresses, even learn to drive. However, they are still under the authority of their parents, who have 
	the final call over decisions. This transition from childhood to adolescence somewhat alters the friction of distance in their 
	lives. Full responsibility occurs during adulthood, where adults take control over the actions and decisions they make in their 
	jobs, careers, and possibly their marriage. This stage is where the greatest change is made in their friction of distance.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Friction of distance actually relates to our travels more than we think. While as children in our early childhood we do not 
	have cars to drive, and our parents restrict the places we are to go. On the other hand, we are able to travel much more as we 
	advance into adolescence: having more opportunities, less restrictions, and better forms of transportation. As adults, our 
	friction of distance is even less limited, as we are able to drive, go to work, and shop. When we age further though, except 
	for repeated visits with our children, shopping, and other related activities, our friction of distance is much more retarded. 
</p>
</div> 
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the idea that a small child has a much smaller "world" in which to move while , as 
	we get older, we ride our bike, drive a car, and eventually overcome the friction of distance by our modes of transportation.</p>

<p><b>3. What do you think are the most important push and pull factors in the country today?<br />
Have they changed in the past 4-5 decades?<br />
How and why?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>America has always had a strong appeal to many immigrants from countries around the world. This may be because of America’s 
	many pull factors, most important of which include religious and political freedom, and economic opportunities. Many immigrants 
	come to America in order to escape or avoid religious persecution and corrupt government. In their minds, America has always 
	been a land of the free, where freedom, liberty, and equality are championed, and where intolerance of other races and cultures 
	is abhorred.  America also has an economic appeal to immigrants who were previously living in overpopulated regions with low 
	wages and limited job opportunities. To them, America promised "a better life" of ease. However, America does have push factors 
	as well. Although it is said to be a nation of equality, immigrants and citizens of different races do still experience social 
	prejudice and hostility. These factors have changed over time, along with the change of immigration rates. The developing 
	industrial state of America in the early 1900’s attracted people from all over the world to its urban cities. Immigration 
	rose and fell from then up until the start of the 21st century, when Mexican migrants came flooding into the US because of
	unemployment, poverty, and crime rates in their own country. This has changed some of the push factors in America, because of 
	tension between locals and migrants. Some citizens feel like the Mexican immigrants are becoming a threat to their society, and 
	there are also concerns that these immigrants are increasing crime rates, particularly in drug related crimes.  Lastly, the 
	political state of the government we are in right now may be pushing people out of the country.</p>

	area will “pull” the migrant to live there. I wouldn’t say that the push factor has changed in the past 4-5 decades, but I 
	think that the pull factor has. Some cities have become richer and richer, drawing more migrants despite their climate-related

<p><b>1. Why is the crude birth rate "crude?"</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>The crude birth rate is known as "crude" because it does not take into account any age or sex differences among the population. 
The denominator of the birth rate includes people who have no chance of giving birth, such as males, young girls, and old women. 
The word "crude" can be attributed to something in a natural or raw state, which has not been processed or refined. In the crude birth 
rate, it simply refers to the fact that the figure has not been statistically corrected or adjusted based on age and sex differences.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>The crude birth rate is “crude” because it simply calculates how many babies are born per 1000 people, not taking into account the 
gender of a person or whether she is in her childbearing ages. This cannot be accurate as some 50 percent of the earth’s populace are 
male, and another large portion of the remaining 50 percent are not old/young enough to bear children. The crude birth rate wobbles the 
preciseness of the birth rate, causing it to be “crude,” and creates a need for a total fertility rate as well.</p>
</div>

	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the words or ideas:<br />
	births related to total population without regard to age or sex composition of that population</p>
</div>
	
	<br /><br />	

<p><b>2. Why isn´t the replacement level of the total fertility rate just 2.0?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Replacement level fertility is the total fertility rate in which the average number of children born to a woman is enough to ensure that 
	the same number of women survive to have offspring themselves. The replacement level of the total fertility rate cannot be 2.0 
	(in which one baby replaces each parent) because of mortality in the female population before childbearing years. TFR has to be 
	greater than 2.0 to compensate for infant and childhood mortalities, childless women, and unexpected deaths. Also, since the 
	birth ratios of males and females are not the same, there is no guarantee of every woman bearing a female child and eventually 
	being replaced by her.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>A total fertility rate of 2.0 children per couple may seem sufficient to keep the population stable (one child for each 
	parent), but really, more children are needed for population growth to make sure that infant mortalities, women who are not 
	able to bear children, and other casualties will not cause population decrease. Many unexpected deaths and childhood 
	mortalities make the population unpredictable, so if the total fertility rate is higher, more children can compensate for 
	these losses and keep the population going. In reality, a minimal TFR of 2.1 to 2.3 children is needed to prevent the 
	population from going down.</p>
</div> 
	
<div id = "teachertext">
	<p>Mark your answer correct if it included the words or idea that:<br />
	While replacement of two parents would seem the correct thing, replacement level is only reached with TFR of 2. 1 - 2.3 or

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Over time, a decrease in population growth of a rapidly growing country will boost up the average age of the population, 
	thus creating a population of dominantly elderly people and very few young dependents. This will drastically change the 
	shape of the country’s population pyramid from an almost perfect pyramid, with a large base of young dependents narrowing down 
	towards the apex of old dependents, to a pyramid with a much narrower base of younger age groups, a wider number of working-age 
	people, and a larger than expected number of elderly people.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>If population growth declines, the number of babies being born will decrease, and the number of the elderly will start 
	increasing. This will make the population pyramid look almost vertical, since the bottom of the pyramid (representing the 
	children) will be compressed. However, since there is still the same amount of adults and elderly, the top of the pyramid 
	(representing the elderly) will swell. This will make the pyramid not much of a pyramid any more, more like a column.</p>

<p><b>4. How does the physical environment help to explain the distribution of the world´s population?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>The distribution of the world’s population reflects not only levels of human and economic development, but also 
	environmental factors. Humans only occupy a very small percentage of earth’s surface, and these permanently inhabited areas
	are known as "ecumene." The uninhabited or sparsely occupied areas, on the other hand, are called "nonecumune," or "anecume." 
	The physical environment greatly affects the location of ecumene and nonecumene areas. For example, population tends to be 
	very low in regions with extreme environments, such as rainforests, deserts, arid or polar areas, and mountainous regions. 
	In an area with a large body of water, large mineral deposits, or highly arable land, however, the population will be much 
	larger. Of course, technology and population growth can dramatically increase the ecumene of humans, but this will also 
	affect the world’s ecosystem.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>The physical environment helps explain the distribution of the world population because the people are more likely to live 
	in certain places. A disproportionate number of the world population lives in the Northern Hemisphere, since the Southern 
	Hemisphere is mostly water. Similarly, almost no one inhabits the polar ice caps. People also tend to settle down in

	<p>Thomas Robert Malthus believed that population growth, without any checks, had the potential to grow exponentially, rapidly 
	exceeding its ability to produce resources to support itself. In other words, when humans have more resources, they are going 
	to respond by having more children, which will cause a "Malthusian catastrophe" in which the lack of resources to support the 
	population will lead to famine, disease, and war. Malthus believed that in order to prevent this chaos and destruction, there 
	needed to be preventative checks to inhibit the reproductive capacity of humans, such as celibacy, birth control, and marrying 
	later. Many governments, in order to achieve equilibrium between population numbers and support resources, have been influenced 
	by the neo-Malthusian theory, which proposes national and international programs of population limitation through birth 
	control and family planning. Government policies in Asian countries, such as the "one-child policy" in China and family 
	planning in India, have generally implemented this theory into their government policies.</p>
</div>

	<p>Malthus’s assumption was that the population would soon grow so large that the food supplies on Earth would not be able to

<p><b>1. Discuss the ways in which religion may affect other cultural traits of a society. As part of your responses, select a world 
religion and relate it to other characteristics of the specific culture of which it is a part.</b><p>

<div id = "polbytext">
<p>Since religion is a mentifact, or a component of the ideological subsystem of culture that shapes the belief system of a society, 
it can affect all aspects of culture. First of all, on a large scale, even atheistic and secular societies are influenced by 
traditional values and customs laid down by previous religions, such as the days of work and rest and national holidays. Cultural 
traits of societies are also heavily dependent on citizens’ observance of certain religious laws such as rituals of holy living found 
in the Torah, Sharia, Dharma, and Confucian teachings. A concrete example of this can be seen in how the required preparation of meat 
for Muslims affects much of the Middle Eastern population. The Muslim religion also requires that women wear head coverings, which 
has become a cultural norm followed by non-Muslim and Muslim women alike. Lastly, religion can leave a big imprint on the cultural 
landscape of a country through religious buildings such as synagogues and mosques.</p>
</div>

<div id = "truffletext">
<p>There are many ways in which we can see how religion affects other cultural traits of a society: through food, for example. 
As seen in the introductory paragraph in the textbook chapter, Muslims will not eat meat if it is not slaughtered in their own 
special way, and since much of the Middle Eastern population is Muslim, meat (a cultural trait) is affected because so much of it 
must be prepared the way Muslims require it to be. Another prominent cultural trait which can be affected through religion is 
clothing. Again taking the Muslims as an example, you see that Muslims believe that women should always wear head coverings. And 
if you visit a dominantly Muslim country, you would most likely notice that all the women you see are probably wearing head coverings. 
Although cultural traits are not so readily affected in other countries, especially countries which advertise free religion, they 
have at least some imprint on their country’s culture. </p>

<p><b>2. Discuss the ways in which a language may reveal its area of origin and the content of the culture that speaks it.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Language is a crucial part of group identity and helps to define many characteristics of ethnic and cultural distinction. 
	People all over the world recognize that cultural heritage is rooted in language, which is why regions such as Quebec are 
	working so hard to prevent the loss of their linguistic identity. Dialects are one way language can influence ethnic cultural 
	and territorial identity.  The vocabulary, pronunciation, rhythm, and speed of a dialect all set groups of speakers apart 
	and reveal their area of origin. Language can also denote levels of socioeconomic status through social dialects, and reflect 
	environment and gender distinctions. For example, Arabic has 80 words pertaining to camels, an animal the culture relies on 
	greatly, Japanese contains more than 20 words for rice, Russian includes many terms for ice and snow, and Hawaiians have 
	108 words for sweet potato. Regarding gender distinctions, all cultures display differences in the way males and females use 
	language, with the larger gaps between the social roles of men and women resulting in more rigid linguistic differences.</p>
</div> 	
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Protolanguages come to mind. Protolanguages are languages from which other languages originate, and nowadays, many tongues 
	are similar to each other and reveal what area of origin the language came from. For example, Italian, French, and Spanish 
	are all part of the group of Romance languages, which originated from Latin. Languages can also reveal the content of its 
	culture because language is a defining part of a culture and reveals much of the essence of a culture.</p>

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>One of the major world religions, Christianity, was spread through a number of different forms of diffusion. Because of its 
	universal message of salvation and hope for all humankind and its emphasis on missionary work, it spread rapidly throughout 
	the underclasses of the Roman Empire , carrying to the major cities and ports through the extensive transportation network of 
	the Romans. Expansion diffusion, or the diffusion of an idea or innovation outward from its hearth, played a major role in 
	dispersing the practice of Christianity throughout Europe. This happened not only via hierarchical diffusion from Rome (the 
	‘hearth’ or principal origin area of Christianity) to smaller provincial capitals and settlements of Europe, but also through 
	the contagious diffusion caused by direct contact that affected nearly uniformly all areas outward from the source region. 
	Christianity was finally spread over the entire world through relocation diffusion, the physical transferral of an idea or 
	innovation to a new area by migrating individuals, and in this case, through missionary efforts. This can be seen in the 
	forced conversion of Native Americans by Spanish colonists, leading to the introduction of Christianity in the New World.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>One of the major world religions, Christianity, was spread through a number of different forms of diffusion. It originated 
	around Israel, which is where Jesus spent most of His life, and since it’s focus is on missionary work, it spread quickly 
	throughout the Roman empire and beyond. Hierarchical diffusion moved Christianity from the main Western church, Rome, to 
	smaller settlements and provincial capitals of the Roman Empire. Then, contagious diffusion brought the religion all 
	throughout Europe. Finally, through forced conversion and other factors of the European exploration of the New World, America 
	also became influenced by Christianity. But another interesting example of diffusion is that of the Protestant Puritans. 
	Because of Catholic persecution, the Puritans relocated to America, and that is why America is predominantly Protestant while 
	Europe remains mostly Catholic or Orthodox.</p>

<p><b>4. Compare and contrast major world religions from the standpoint of thier impact on the landscape.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>All major world religions have their impact on the cultural landscape, regardless of whether it is obvious or subtle. Both 
	structures of religious worship, such as temples or mosques, and religious landscapes of death are visible regional variables 
	that leave a cultural stamp on the landscape. Religions can also convey distinctive cultural imprints through the recognition 
	of revered sacred places in the environment, including rivers, mountains, lakes, and grottos. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, 
	and Hinduism are similar in that each of these religions leaves a vivid and prominent mark on the cultural landscape. In early 
	Catholic communities, the parish church, or cathedral, formed the center of life for rural neighborhoods, with activity 
	clustering around the village center. The same is true for Islamic communities where mosques are the focal point of Islamic 
	communal life and a primary imprint on the landscape. Buddhism and Hinduism can be said to have an even greater impact on 
	both the cultural and physical landscape, with images and statues of Buddha decorating Buddhist stupas, temples, and 
	monasteries, and Hindu rituals, ceremonies, and feasts greatly regulating the lifestyles of Hindus. Judaism, on the other 
	hand, has made only small and subtle changes to the landscape, such as the cultivation of grapes for the religious use of wine 
	and synagogues used as the place for worship. In regards to landscapes of death created by each religion, Jews, Christians, 
	and Muslims all typically bury their dead in cemeteries with markers and monuments to mark the graves. Hindus and Buddhists, 
	however, traditionally cremate their dead and scatter their ashes, leaving no evident imprint on the landscape.</p>
</div>
	
<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Major world religions make changes to the cultural landscape both discreetly and indiscreetly. The most obvious of these

	in Buddhism. Buddhists have created architectural changes through images and statues of Buddhas and three types of buildings: 
	stupas, temples, and monasteries. But other may be more discreet. Jews, for example, have made only small and subtle changes 
	to their landscape; their synagogues are not as decorative and massive as the worship hubs of other religions, and the only 
	things they need other than synagogues are fields for agricultural needs as well as burial of the dead. Besides architecture,

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Lingua francas are established languages used habitually for communication by people whose native tongues are mutually 
	incomprehensible. A lingua franca is basically a second language, or one learned in addition to the native tongue. Especially

<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Nigeria, unlike many other countries, is composed of over 500 different tribal languages, some of which are already 
	extinct, some of which are going extinct, and some of which are mutually incomprehensible. This makes it crucial that the 
	country should have English as its lingua franca, since English is a universal language and will avoid confusion and division 
	among the people. Having one language also promotes unity and peace throughout the country and ensures that groups of people 
	speaking dominant languages will not try to subjugate those who speak less important languages than them.</p>

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>In my opinion, I do think that the United States should make English its official language. Of course, people should be 
	allowed and even encouraged to learn other languages, but institutionalizing an officially recognized, common language will 
	create a less divisive society of united citizens able to function efficiently. An official language will also save billions 
	of dollars in federal spending on translators and bilingual education. Most importantly, however, an official language 
	encourages immigrants to develop the ability necessary for socioeconomic advancement and democratic participation in this 
	country. Many immigrants who don’t speak English find themselves negatively affected by limited employment opportunities. 
	By providing services to non-English populations, we are further dividing the American people and strengthening the ethnic 
	stereotypes by creating both linguistic and employment “ghettos.”</p>

<div id = "truffletext">
	<p>Personally, I am convinced that the United States should not have an official language. Among the various reasons that I 
	think this, one stands out. America was founded upon the priceless concept of freedom. Years later, a famous title was 
	invented that most aptly described our country and became a household name: melting pot. The United States was a mix of all 
	the different ethnicities and people groups that sought a free society, the United States was a mix of all the capabilities 
	and beliefs these people had. In my opinion, an official language would be a hindrance to this foundational concept, because 
	although it would be helpful in uniting the people and saving federal costs on bilingual education, it will force many new

	<p>The categorization of religions as universalizing, ethnic, and tribal clearly reflect their patterns and processes of 
	spatial diffusion. Because universalizing religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam, seek to transmit their 
	beliefs through missionary work and conversion, and do not exclude anyone because of nationality or ethnicity, these 
	religions tend to be very expansionary, spreading quickly to new peoples in new areas. Conversely, ethnic religions have 
	strong territorial and cultural group identification, forming distinctive communities identified with a particular ethnic 
	group. In ethnic religions, members only become part of an ethnic religion by birth or adoption/immersion into the new lifestyle and culture. Ethnic religions are usually regionally confined and expand very slowly over long periods of time. Similarly, tribal religions identify with small localized culture groups, and practice close ties to nature. Thus, they contract in size as members become either increasingly modernized or convert to an universalizing religion.</p>

<p><b>4. Compare and contrast the ethnic streams that went into the United States with those that migrated to Canada.</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>The ethnic diversity evident in North America today is the result of the continuous immigrant flows to this continent from 
	nearly all cultures and races of the world. For both the United States and Canada, that movement took the form of three 
	distinct immigrant waves. The first wave for the US lasted from pioneer settlement to about 1870, and was made up of two 
	ethnic groups: white arrivals from Europe (especially Britain and Germany) who established a majority society controlled 
	by Protestant Anglo-Saxons, and the African slaves brought involuntarily to the New World. The first ethnic stream of Canada, 
	on the other hand, was composed of mainly French settlers up until 1760. After that date, however, the pattern abruptly 
	changed, starting the second wave as UK immigrants began flooding into Canada, many of them fleeing from the US as Loyalists 
	during and after the American Revolutionary War. America’s second immigrant stream occurred as a result of the mass 
	immigration beginning after the middle of the 19th century which reduced both European dominance in society and the 
	percentage of blacks within the population. This period, lasting from 1870 to 1914 ended with the congressional adoption of a 
	quota system regulating both the number of individuals who would be accepted and the countries from which they could come. 
	Both this system and World War II greatly slowed immigration until a third wave was begun with the Immigration and 
	Nationality Act of 1965. Since then, millions of immigrants have entered the US, with Hispanics dominating the inflow. 
	Canada’s last shift in migration pattern occurred during the 20th century, with immigration today accounting for approximately 
	more than half of its population growth.</p>

	when U.S. immigration policies loosened and Latin Americans/Asians rushed in. Canada experienced a much different flow.
	First the French came and then, after 1760, English, Scotch, and Irish made up the second great ethnic stream into Canada. 
	During the mid-20th century, a third stream, mainly from Europe came into Canada and were joined by Asian migrants, too.

	provinces of Canada, the Pennsylvania Dutch, and the Latter-day Saints (Mormons) in Utah were also all examples of cluster 
	migration. Later in the century, however, the disappearance of land available for homesteading and the changes in immigrant 
	flows reduced cluster migration and instead led to the assemblage in one area of the relatives, friends, or compatriots of 
	the first arrivals. In this effect of chain migration, prospective arrivals were attracted by both favorable reports and

<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Ethnocentrism refers to the tendency to evaluate other cultures against the standards of one’s own. Although this can

	Another vital survival tool for new immigrants in an unfamiliar world is the formation and clustering of specific groups 
	into ethnically homogenous neighborhoods. This self-elected segregation of ethnic groups can provide four principal 
	functions, the first of which is defense. A defined ethnic territory reduces individual immigrant isolation and provides 
	members of the group with security from the hostility of antagonistic social groups. Physical association within a limited 
	area also provides support for its residents by serving as a halfway station between the home country and the alien society 
	and acting as a place of initiation and indoctrination to ease the transition to a new society. Thirdly, ethnic groups can 
	provide a preservation function, reflecting a disinclination to be absorbed into the charter society and a desire to preserve 
	and promote essential elements of the cultural heritage. Finally, ethnic spatial concentration can serve as an attack 
	function, a peaceful search for political representation by a concentration of electoral power.</p>

	northern ghetto, reflected an integration of English country dancing, Anglo American folk song, and West African musical 
	patterns. The folk music was basically choral and instrumental in character and made rhythm by means of clapping hands and 
	stomping feet. It featured a strong beat, a leader-chorus style, and deep-pitched mellow voices.</p>

<p><b>8. What traces of folk culture do you exhibit in your own family life and community?</b></p>
	
<div id = "polbytext">
	<p>Since our parents immigrated from China, my family does not exhibit any traces of folk culture seen in regions of America. However, we do display certain aspects of Asian or Chinese folk culture in our daily life.  In regards to food and drink distinguishable to the Chinese cuisine, our diet is very close to the typical meals eaten by native Chinese people, including cultural delicacies such as fish eyes and chicken feet. My mom also loves brining and pickling vegetables, incorporating aspects of the Korean cuisine, as well as fermenting curiously fruity and bubbly drinks such as fermented rice wine.<br />
	Our family enjoys frequently sharing old Chinese folk songs, proverbs, and fables with each other as well as watching old Chinese operas and Chinese folk dances. Some other traces of folk culture that we do not exhibit in our family life but enjoy buying as traditional Chinese decorations are Chinese paper cuttings and decorative knots. The most important trait of Chinese folk culture in our household, however, has to be our observance of the Chinese New Year along with the customs for each day of the 15 day celebration. These traditions involve hanging up red lanterns and decorations, exchanging red envelopes, and eating filled dumplings (jaozi), sweet rice dumplings (tangyuan), and delicious mooncakes.</p>

	your own personal family and community!</p>
