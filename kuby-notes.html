<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We will learn about ways that maps can distort and manipulate information through:</span></p>
</div> 

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choice of projection,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simplification or decisions about what to include or leave off a map,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change of scale,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">level of aggregation, and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choice of map type. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many ways to construct a map! &nbsp;Choices about the above variables will really affect the message the map conveys!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 1 &ldquo;True Maps, False Impressions&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; The Five Themes of Human Geography are discussed and the important components of maps are covered in-depth. Various types of maps are investigated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Human Geography:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studies the distribution of humans and their activities on the surface of the earth and the processes that generate these distributions; Geographers help us understand the evolving character and organization of human life on the Earth&rsquo;s surface</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geographers bring their unique spatial perspective and interest in human-environmental relations by asking questions about the same pressing human problems that engage other social and environmental scientists</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- THe &ldquo;Where&rdquo; question leads to five overarching themes in human geography:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Location</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- exact coordinates of a place and where it is relative to other factors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Place-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involves human and physical characteristics that uniquely define a place and impart meaning to its inhabitants</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Region</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- defines areas that are bound together by common characteristics; an area on Earth with a unique combination of features</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Movement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- of information, goods, and people connect locations and regions to each other</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Human-environmental Interactions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- humans and their environment interact in both directions: environmental resources constrain and benefit human societies, while human activities refashion and degrade the environments</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Geography&rsquo;s spatial perspective and all five themes lead to the heavy use of </span><strong>maps-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a two dimensional graphical representation of the surface of the earth; no map can perfectly represent reality</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Cartographers make five critical decisions about map construction that greatly influence the message conveyed by the map</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Map Projection</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- systematic method of transferring the spherical surface of the Earth to a flat map; every projection is distorted in one way or another, and this influences the impression about the size and proximity of different regions of the world (Robinson projection in 1998 better portrays the relationship between land and water and does not distort countries a lot)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Simplification-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> omission, straightening, exaggeration, and distortion ( shape, distance, size, and direction)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Map Scale-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the degree to which a map zooms in on an area; can be defined as the ratio of map distance (distance between two points on a map) to Earth distance (distance between those two points on the surface of the Earth; the ratio of the distance on the map to the distance on the ground where both are measured in the same units; every map has a scale, and the degree of generalization depends on that scale; a large scale map depicts a small area with great detail; a small scale map depicts a large area with less detail; a large fraction means large scale; a small fraction means small scale</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Scale is more than just a way of zooming in or out for a closer look or broader perspective. When you change scales, you can actually see different spatial processes at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Scale can be represented in three different ways: </span><strong>Representative Fraction-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the map distance to ground distance ratio is written as a simple fraction or ratio; it simply means that on unit on the map represents however much fraction of the same unit on the ground;</span><strong> Verbal Scale</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- words instead of numbers; translation of the representative fraction (eg. 1: 100, 000 can be expressed as &ldquo;one centimeter to one kilometer&rdquo; or &ldquo;one centimeter represents one kilometer&rdquo; b/c there are 100 centimeters in 1 meter and 1000 meters in 1 kilometer); and </span><strong>Graphic Scale</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- appears as a line or bar divided into numbered segments</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Data Aggregation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the size of the geographic units under investigation; a particular pattern revealed at one level of aggregation does not appear at another- influences the spatial patterns we see</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type of maps-</span><strong> Reference map</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">s (common features, general purpose maps) and</span><strong> thematic maps </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(maps that highlight a particular feature or single variable)</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Isoline maps</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- show lines that connect points of equal value (eg. topographic map); crossing an isoline amounts to going up or down that surface (increasing or decreasing the value being mapped)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Choropleth map</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- shows the level of some variable within regions; categorizes variable into classes and depicts each class with different shades of color</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Proportional symbol map</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- uses symbol such as a circle to show intensity or frequency; size of the symbol varies with the frequency or size of the variable being mapped</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dot maps-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use a dot to represent the occurrence of some phenomenon in order to depict variation in density</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Spatial data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- have a geographic or locational component</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- 2 types of data Geographers use: </span><strong>Primary data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (measured or obtained directly by researchers or their equipment) and </span><strong>Secondary data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (obtained from another source that has previously collected the data</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Geographic Information system</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- spatial database linked to a graphic display</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- T</span><strong>oponym</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a place name, especially one derived from a topographical feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Historical vs. geographic view of knowledge: Events vs. location (chronological vs. chorological</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Hearth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The place from which an innovation originates</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Earth&rsquo;s four systems: </span><strong>Atmosphere</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - thin layer of gases surrounding Earth, </span><strong>Hydrosphere</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- water on or near Earth&rsquo;s surface, </span><strong>Lithosphere </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; Earth&rsquo;s crust</span><strong>, Biosphere</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - &nbsp;all living organisms on Earth &ndash; plants and animals</span></p>
<p><strong>- Ecosystem</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">s: &nbsp;A group of living organisms and the abiotic spheres with which they interact</span></p>
<p><strong>- Cultural ecology or human geography</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The geographic study of human-environment relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Environmental determinism-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> physical environment caused people&rsquo;s actions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Possibilism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- people can change or adjust to the environment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Modifying </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the environment- Technology facilitates</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-2">Chapter 2: Layers Of Tradition</h2> 

<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 2 &ldquo;Layers of Tradition&rdquo;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; Learn about functional and perceptual regions when discussing culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;Discover what syncretism , core, domain, and sphere are when discussing a culture region.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Culture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- aspect of humanity that differentiates people and shapes the places we create; refers to a people&rsquo;s way of life, their behavior, and their shared understandings about themselves and the world</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Culture encompasses</span><strong> technological </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(how we perform tasks), </span><strong>sociological</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (how we relate to others), and </span><strong>ideological </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(what we believe) aspects of human life; serves as a guide for how we act and interpret the world around us, and is passed on from generation through formal instruction and imitation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Region</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an area with common characteristics; an area characterized by similarity or a cohesiveness that sets it apart from other regions- similarity can take the form of a common characteristic- geographic proximity, dominant crop, economic base, common history, or common set of trading partners; aspects of culture- the complexities of human lifestyles, including social arrangements, the use of land and resources, language, and spiritual and political beliefs- are some of the features used to define regions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- All regions are mental constructs- different conceptions; conceptualizing a region is a method geographers use to impose order on the messy complexities of the real world- to make sense of geographic chaos; just as organizing time into blocks of ears helps people understand history better, so organizing space into regions help people understand geography better</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- regions vary in scale from local to global; the degree of detail correlates to the familiarity people have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Three types of regions:</span></p>
<p><strong>- Formal region</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a common human characteristic such as language, religion, or level of economic development or a common physical attribute such as climate, landform, or vegetation</span></p>
<p><strong>- Functional region</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- held together by a common set of linkages or spatial interactions organized around one or several nodes- transportation flows, information exchanges, and movements of people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-CIty and suburban residents are intertwined by a complicated web of economic, social, and political interactions into one functional region</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Megalopolis-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coalescence of metropolitan areas into a continuous network of urban development; a megalopolis is a formal region in that it represents a dense concentration of human activity and the dominance of urban over rural land uses; it is also a functional region because it is linked by extensive movements of people, goods, and information</span></p>
<p><strong>- Perceptual region-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on people&rsquo;s feelings or beliefs about areas and are subjective rather than objective in nature</span></p>
<p><strong>- Vernacular region-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> type of perceptual region- identified by local residents, not as outsiders perceive them- traits of the common folk- speech, architecture, dress</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Culture traits- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">characteristics that best represent the place to define it- an be technological, sociological, and ideological</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Culture region-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defined by cultural traits- for example a culture region can be delimited b the prevalence of words people use for soft drinks, different barbecue styles, and barn styles</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>REgional identity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- inhabitants are aware to some degree of a common cultural heritage and differences from other territorial groups; consciousness of belonging to a group united in a common territory- what geographers look for when studying vernacular regions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Regional identity can be problematic as there is often no central unifying cultural belief or single identity but a multiplicity of belief systems and group allegiances; much of the landscape we see reflect the cultural beliefs of those with power and the majority, but do not represent minorities or disenfranchised groups</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Vernacular regions stem from human emotions and feelings about place; regions have meaning for their inhabitants and form part of resident&rsquo;s cultural identity; a culture region both shapes and is shaped by people&rsquo;s behaviors in their unique geographic setting, or </span><strong>milieu</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Genres de vie</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- &ldquo;ways of life&rdquo;- an integration of environmental, spiritual, and cultural practices in a region; interaction between physical characteristics of regions and cultural lifestyles</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- People incorporate the organic construction of space through the long coevolution of lifestyles and landscapes into their regional identity and attachment to place; culture is continually constructed by people as they shape their world and express their identity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Cultural landscape</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- modifications people make on their environment to their specific needs, technologies, and lifestyles</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the value system of a culture affects the way people perceive and use the natural environment and thus the way the cultural landscape looks</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Culture symbols</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- how people express cultural beliefs- monuments, flags, slogans; as well as through symbolic meaning that is associated with artifacts such as landscaping, house types; symbols express people&rsquo;s identities and promote ideology</span></p>
<p><strong>- Core</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the centralized zone of concentration, or most pure area that possesses all of the culture traits used to define the region- the heart, soul, vital center, and focus of circulation of a culture region</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Domain-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> area in which the particular culture is dominant but less intense</span></p>
<p><strong>- Sphere-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> zone of outer influence where people with the culture traits in question can be a minority </span></p>
<p><strong>- Syncretism- n</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">ew cultural traits emerge as a cultural hybrid of two distinct parent traits</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Ecological trilogy-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interactions among three kinds of communities- villages, tribe, and city- each part represented a unique cultural landscape that adapted to the environment but also modified it</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-3">Chapter 3: Tracking The AIDS Epidemic In The United States</h2>

<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 3 &ldquo;Tracking the AIDS Epidemic&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; Learn about the many types of diffusion- spatial, expansion, relocation, hierarchical &ndash; and how they operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now know a little more about spatial interactions and complementarity, intervening opportunity, and transferability, and how the flows of goods and services help channel people, their jobs, and consequent migrations, or movements from one location to another.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBu6jKJg5So" target = "_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBu6jKJg5So</span></a></p>
</div>

<p><strong>- Spatial diffusion-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spread of some phenomenon over space and through time from a limited number of origins; places can affect other places through this process</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- All phenomena that diffuse, no matter how dissimilar, share general spatial patterns and processes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Torsten Hagerstrand identified four types of diffusion: relocation and expansion diffusion and contagious and hierarchical diffusion</span></p>
<p><strong>- Relocation diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- occurs when items being diffused leave the original areas behind as they move to new areas. Although cultural traits are carried with the people who move, the number of adopters stays the same</span></p>
<p><strong>- Expansion diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the process whereby the item spreads geographically by passing from one person to another while remaining with the first person; the number of people adopting the item expands</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Relocation diffusion is generally followed by expansion diffusion; the adoption of phenomena generally follows an S-shaped curve</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Where you live has something to do with when the diffusing phenomenon reaches you</span></p>
<p><strong>- Contagious diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">/effect- places near the origin are usually affected first; the father from the point or points or origin, the later you will be affected; this process is strongly influenced by distance</span></p>
<p><strong>- Hierarchical effect</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">s/diffusion- occur when phenomena spread first to major cities, then to intermediate-size places, and later to small towns and rural areas; diffusion processes do not always follow the rule of distance or spread in expanding ripples and linear waves; sometimes distance is less important to the spread of an irea than contact with major cities or influential people</span></p>
<p><strong>- Urban hierarchy-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down from large cities to small places; occurs for several reasons: larger places have a greater potential for interaction: &nbsp;more travel and contact occur between large cities, more carriers of ideas come to large cities, they have more interactions with other people and places; the people in larger cities tend to be more diverse, wealthy, and accustomed to change; industries in large cities also tend to be more diverse and and willing to adopt new technologies and practices</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Contagious and hierarchical are different in that innovation in hierarchical skip and jump from place to place instead of spreading like a wave in contagious diffusion</span></p>
<p><strong>- Barriers to diffusion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- also influences spatial patterns of diffusion; can be physical in nature or cultural; eg. language barriers, political barriers, mountains, rivers; cultural and social factors can also facilitate diffusion</span></p>
<p><strong>- Biased innovations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- diffuse according to social context rather than spatial context</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 5 in Kuby &ldquo;One Billion and Counting&rdquo; Learn about the demographic transition model as a framework for understanding variations in birth, death, and growth rates worldwide.</span></p>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The size, composition, and growth of populations affect the economic and environmental well-being of nations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Population change in any country results from 4 demographic forces: births, deaths, immigration, and emigration</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- P2=P1=B-D=I-O</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- P1=population in time 1; P2=population in time 2; B=births; D=deaths; I=in-migrants; O=out-migrants</span></p>
<p><strong>- CBR</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the number of births per 1000, is a measure of the birth performance of a population;</span><strong> CDR</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the number of deaths per 1000, is an indicator of a population&rsquo;s death experience; both are called crude because they fail to account for the different age structures of populations</span></p>
<p><strong>- Crude rate of natural increase</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the difference between the CBR and CDR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Demographic transition model-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> framework for understanding the dramatic variations in birth, death, and growth rates worldwide; offers a generalized perspective of the way birth, death, and growth rates change over time</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Equilibrium-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a state in which the forces making for change are in balance</span></p>
<p><strong>- Population pyramid</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- two-sided bar chart showing the distribution of population in various age categories, or </span><strong>cohorts</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Age-specific birth rates-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a precise indicator of the number of births occurring in each age cohort; the number of births to a women in a specific age cohort divided by the number of women in that age cohort</span></p>
<p><strong>- Total Fertility rate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- also called average family size- the number of children an average woman would bear as she passes through her reproductive years</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong> Zero population growth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- when the number of births is equal to the number of deaths</span></p>
<p><strong>- Demographic momentum/ Hidden momentum</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of population growth- a tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved; why a long lag occurs between declining fertility and the end of population growth</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-6">Chapter 6: Help Wanted</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we will learn more about economic activities by studying the most-used labor classification system. &nbsp;This information WILL appear in some form on the exam so make sure you understand it! Localization economies are an important concept here. &nbsp;Localization economies are agglomerations, or groupings, of conditions that occur in certain places based on the prevailing industries. Sometimes all the raw materials needed to make a product are easily obtained in a certain city or location causing the industry to centralize there. &nbsp;Glass is one example of this localization of economies for an industry's siting. &nbsp;West Virginia (and even western PA) have historically had the raw materials such as sand and the energy resources (coal) and the transportation systems (many rivers) to develop a strong glass-making industry. Can you think of an industry in your community or region that formed as a result of these localization economies?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 6 &ldquo;Help Wanted&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; Learn about the classification system for economic activity and what localization and urbanization economies are and how they operate.</span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>-Primary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic activities that extract raw materials directly from the earth. Include agriculture, forestry, fishing, trapping, and mining. Some are used in their natural form, but others are not. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Secondary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufacturing operations that transform raw materials into more usable forms. Add more value to raw materials: wheat into flour, copper ore into wire, etc. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tertiary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third sector of the economy. Takes the goods that are produced and manufactured by the primary and secondary sectors and either sells them to consumers or uses them to perform services for consumers. The tertiary sector includes wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, finance, transportation and communications, medicine, law, education, tourism, and entertainment. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Services- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasks that you pay others to do for you. The service sector involves many occupations that do not require a high level of education or training (which are referred to as low-skill jobs). </span></p>
<p><strong>-Quaternary Activities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most dynamic part of today&rsquo;s service sector; includes highly skilled, information-based services concerned with research and development (R&amp;D), management and administration, and processing and disseminating information. A subset of the tertiary sector in that they are services that people do for other people using equipment manufactured by the secondary sector. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Cost-Minimizing Location- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any economic activity, depends on what it is producing. Different economic activities have different cost structures: some pay a lot for raw materials or transportation costs, whereas others pay a lot for land, unskilled labor, skilled labor, capital, or information. Cost structures vary not only among the economic sectors but also within them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firms for which transportation costs account for a large share of total costs tend to locate their factories where the total transportation cost of (1) assembling their physical inputs plus (2) distributing their products is as low as possible. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Three distinctly different locational orientations led by transport cost minimization:</span></p>
<p><strong>-Raw-Material-Oriented Industry- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a firm&rsquo;s raw materials are quite heavy relative to the weight of the final product, and if those materials are found in only a few locations, transport costs are minimized by locating near the raw material sites; for example, paper manufacturing. Oriented toward primary activities and raw material production. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Market-Oriented- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd type of transport cost minimizing location- near major markets for the products;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">if the transport costs of the final product exceed those of the raw materials. Will profit by locating near its customers. </span></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Ubiquitous- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If some of the raw materials are ubiquitous, they can be found almost anywhere and therefore do not need to be transported to the factory. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Break-Of-Bulk- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a location between the raw materials and the market can minimize transport costs. This third type of transport cost minimization is at break-of-bulk points. These are places where a large shipment of raw materials is divided into smaller lots, often at ports where goods must be unloaded from one mode of transportation and reloaded onto another. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Agglomeration Economies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost savings obtained by clustering. By locating within an agglomeration, firms can minimize their transaction costs.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Transaction Costs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional costs of purchasing or selling a good or service beyond its actual price and transportation costs. Include the costs of identifying buyers and sellers, finding and attracting skilled workers and investors, etc. They are sometimes referred to as the hidden costs of doing business because they are very difficult to measure. Even though they don&rsquo;t appear as a separate item in a company&rsquo;s financial statement, they are very real costs that can make or break a company. These costs are highest in complex and rapidly changing industries. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Externalities- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transaction cost savings accrued from locating within an agglomeration. Effects that are external to any one firm but internal to the cluster as a whole. We can distinguish between two kinds of agglomeration:</span></p>
<p><strong>-Localization Effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The externalities extend mainly to firms within a single industry.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Urbanization Effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The externalities extend to all firms in the area. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Localization Economies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples: carpets in Dalton, GA; glass in West Virginia; chemicals in TX, fashion in Milan; aircraft in Seattle, etc. This type of agglomeration can occur in an area as small as a few city blocks or as large as a metropolitan area. Several mechanisms act to reinforce an initial industrial cluster and create a snowballing effect that attracts more activity to the cluster. </span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agglomerations allow specialized support networks of suppliers and services to emerge, but not until a critical mass of demand for their products and services is reached. Specialized suppliers need sufficient demand in order to justify their investment in the specialized equipment and labor. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of skilled labor. Agglomerations attract specialized workers, who migrate to them despite the high cost of living and traffic congestion. The critical mass of skilled workers then attracts more companies needing top workers, which in turn attracts more skilled workers, and so on in a self reinforcing cycle that minimizes transaction costs for employers and workers</span></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-Technology Spillovers- <span style="font-weight: 400;">technological, scientific, and business information that passes among people and companies. The essence of technological spillovers is captured by the phrase &ldquo;being in the loop.&rdquo; </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Urbanization Economies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second type of agglomeration economy; Cost saving externalities derive from an increase in the size of the place and accrue to all firms. Partly because larger cities provide large markets also because larger cities provide many goods and services that a firm located in a smaller city or rural area might otherwise have to provide-in-house. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Producer Services- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as business services. Most large cities offer a wide array of them, which include &nbsp;engineering firms, advertising agencies, printing shops, etc. Economic clustering of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary companies in metropolitan areas including Toronto, NY, Chicago, and LA is partly the result of urbanization economies that minimize the transaction costs among myriad urban businesses. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spatial Division of Labor- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firms seek a balance to minimize their total costs. Thus, the labor savings of locating in distant low-wage countries must be weighed against higher transportation and transaction costs. One way companies get around this trade-off is through a spatial division of labor.. Different stages of production can be spatially separated, with each located to minimize its own particular cost structure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Headquarters, management, and research and development functions are often located in world cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Atlanta, London, Paris, Tokyo, and Singapore that are well served by global transport and communications networks, capital markets, and highly educated labor pools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- More routine manufacturing or information processing tasks are frequently relocated to branch plants and back offices in areas with lower labor costs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Similarly, banks and insurance companies are mainly headquartered in New York, London, and Tokyo, but their back office credit card processing operations are located in places such as Phoenix, Omaha, and Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The spatial division of labor occurs at the local scale as well; more command and control tasks requiring face to face interactions with other professionals are located in downtowns of large cities, whereas more routine functions are moved to suburban areas with lower rents. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Basic Industries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regions are interested in attracting new ones. They are those that sell outside the local region and thus bring new money into the region. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nonbasic Industries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to basic industries, they produce mainly for the local market, supplying the needs of the region&rsquo;s inhabitants and businesses. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Economic Base Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to it, exports from basic industries are the engine of regional development. They bring in money from outside to employ workers in the basic industries; further, each job created in the basic sector creates more jobs in the nonbasic sector. This relationship is called the...</span></p>
<p><strong>-Regional Multiplier- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the total number of jobs created in the basic and nonbasic sectors for each new basic job in a region. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Industrial Economy- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieved great wealth through three processes: mechanization, economies of scale, and specialization-all of which increased the productivity of labor. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Labor Productivity- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A measure of output per worker per hour. The more each worker produces per hour, the more wages and/or profits increase. Mechanization, or substitution of capital for labor, is one way to increase labor productivity. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Capital Goods- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those used to produce other goods, including machines tools, computers, buildings, and vehicles. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Economies Of Scale- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">second key to increasing productivity in the industrial economy-</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost savings that result from producing a larger amount of output. Economies of scale result partly from larger machines, and can also be achieved through horizontal and vertical integration</span></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Horizontal Integration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying other companies at the same stage of the production process, allowing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;production of a wider range of products and more pricing power in the marketplace.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Vertical Integration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involves expanding into upstream and downstream businesses, that is, companies at earlier or later stages in the production and distribution process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- A third method of increasing productivity involves the process of specialization; as firms get larger, they can hird particular people for narrowly defined jobs; and as workers specialize, so does the capital equipment they use and the training they receive</span></p>
<p><strong>-Division Of Labor- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enables specialized workers to do individual tasks better than a generalist and to save time by not switching among tasks. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Postindustrial Economy- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as the New Economy or the information economy, applies the same principles of mechanization, economies of scale, and specialization to services, education, leisure activities, and the processing and exchange of information by telecommunications and computers. Information is now viewed as the most valuable resource in increasing productivity, even more than energy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Changes in today&rsquo;s economy- service corporations are now among the largest corporations in America; another huge change is increasing globalization- firms globalize to achieve economies of scale and greater specialization through larger markets, as well as cheap labor and resources</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Globalization of manufacturing and the spatial division of labor would not have been possible without technological advances in transportation and communications, including cheap overseas container shipping, ari travel, and instant communications with subsidiaries by telephone, email, and fax</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The New Economy, with its emphasis on innovation, has spawned an increasing number of local agglomerations of particular industries</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- These local agglomerations have been associated with a shift in industrial organization away from vertically integrated mass production processes toward a more flexible production process</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Flexibility includes more flexible use of equipment (programmable machinery), more flexible organizational strategies (alliances, </span><strong>outsourcing</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of parts production and corporate tasks to subcontractors, vertical disintegration), a more flexible range of products for a more diverse market of consumers, more flexibility in bringing innovative products to market faster, more flexible relations with employees (less job security, temporary workers, telecommuting, family leaves, flex time), and more flexible mobility of capital around the word</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-7">Chapter 7: Rags And Riches</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we will begin our study of development. &nbsp;The almost 200 countries of the world can be labeled as developed or developing according to how well they are providing material needs of their inhabitants. &nbsp;The Human Development Index (HDI) measures a country's level of development using various factors. &nbsp;You will be learning about DC's and LDC's and how they are classified by geographers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 7 &ldquo;From Rags to Riches&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; Study the core-periphery model to learn about national and international differences in development.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Huge differences in human welfare and standards of living now separate the countries of the world. Many indicator of development show that the gap between the rich and poor is increasing over time</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, countries are seen as falling along a continuum of development. Development, which implies modernization and progress, was once defined in strictly economic terms, but human progress cannot be measured in monetary terms alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Usual indicators of development:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per capita; The total dollar value of all final goods and services sold in monetary transactions in a country in a given year, excluding overseas transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Gross National Product (GNP)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total dollar value of all final goods and services sold in monetary transactions in a country in a given year, including international transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Percent of the Workforce In Non-Agricultural Activities</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Infant Mortality Rate- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deaths of children less than 1 year of age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Female Literacy Rate</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- To geographers and others, development has come to mean the extent to which a society is making effective use of its resources, both human and natural- recognizes that different regions have different resources with which to work with and may aspire to different goals</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The income gap between the rich and poor have widened, but the middle is muddled; in the 20th century, the distinction between MDC&rsquo;s and LDC&rsquo;s was clear- this classification system was crude but useful as a starting point in discussions of world patterns of development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>More Developed Countries (MDC)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known generally as the northern tier of countries (US, Canada, Europe, the Soviet Union, and Japan) plus Australia and New Zealand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Less Developed Countries (LDC)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">All other countries other than the countries shown above. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Economic Indicators- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development indicators based on a country&rsquo;s economic production, what kind of things it produces, and how it produces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- During the last half of the 20th century, the way social scientists think about development and their real world strategies evolved to combat poverty</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Development Schools Of Thought- </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Modernization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominated the postwar era. The predominant idea was that the former colonies should follow the path taken by Western Europe and North America during the Industrial Revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Structural Change- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MDCs progressed through structural change in the makeup of their economies. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Subsistence Economy- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional, dominated by agriculture. The MDCs passed from through a series of changes from here to a modern, commercial economy dominated first by industry and later by the service sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- This modernization of MDC&rsquo;s was made possible by building 1) the physical infrastructure of transport, energy, and water systems 2) the social institutions needed for capitalism, such as currency, private property, taxes, banks, insurance, and a legal system- the keys to creating wealth were seen as mass production, labor specialization, and</span><strong> substitution of capital for labor</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Technology Transfer- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many agencies (World Bank, International Monetary FUnd, US Agency for International Development) were created to facilitate this and investment from rich to poor countries. Many of these projects were huge, Western style power plants, factories, roads, and port facilities expected to jump start an industrial economy, the benefits of which would eventually trickle down to the masses</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Dependency School- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominated in the 1970s. After several decades of modernization policies in which few LDC&rsquo;s progressed linearly from stage to stage as expected. Argued that the dynamic between the developed and developing worlds kept the latter poor and economically dependent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Core-Periphery Model- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spatial framework for how economies develop over time and space. The model says that the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">preindustrial order or structure of independent local centers with small market areas and little interaction is characterized by small inequalities in wealth and development with regions that function in relative isolation from each other. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beginnings of early industrialization bring the concentration of investment, wealth, and power into a single strong center, or core. Growth in the modern, dynamic core is distinguished by secondary, tertiary, and quaternary activity, and it occurs at the expense of a more traditional periphery dominated by primary economic activities. The periphery supplies/provides raw materials and labor at cheap prices to the urban industrial core, and the core supplies expensive manufactured goods back to the periphery. The net result is a draining of wealth from the periphery to the core; Regional inequalities in development are greatest in this stage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, as industry develops, the simple core-periphery structure is transformed into a multinuclear structure with strong subcenters emerging in the periphery; the core remains the dominant center but regional subcenters begin to emerge; the core and regional subcenters exchange manufactured goods and services while continuing to receive raw material and labor from the periphery; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, a mature and functionally interconnected national economy/space economy emerges or should arise in which the periphery has been absorbed into nearby metropolitan economies. Regional inequalities in wealth are again small at this stage of development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- This model has been used to explain both national and international differences (at the global scale, polarization forces continue to concentrate growth and development in the core, and inequalities between rich and poor countries grow, altough the peripheral areas that have evolved into regional subcenters in the global core periphery framework are experiencing the fastet growth of all; we can also see the trickle down effects, as labor intensive industries disperse outward from the high wage coreand the regional subcenters to the low wage periphery) in economic development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It also explains development within LDC&rsquo;s- most of them are in stage 2 or 3</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- it shows changing spatial inequalities that occur during the process of industrialization; many countries remain in stage 2 or 3, seemingly stalled in the global periphery and lacking a strong internal economy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">--The growth and then decline of inequalities between rich and poor regions are driven by processes of concentration and deconcentration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Polarization effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forces of concentration. Reinforce growth in the core at the expense of the periphery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Circular and cumulative causation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way polarization effects work. In which forces set into motion a sequence of other forces that create a self-sustaining snowballing effect. There are four pathways to this: capital, labor, innovation, and services. These forces reinforce each other in a positive feedback loop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Capital Investment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- attracted to the core, retarding growth in the periphery.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Labor- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young, educated workers migrate to the core, leaving an older, less-dynamic labor force behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Innovation- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">More of this in the core leads the the creation of new or enlarged industries, which in turn breed more innovation, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Services- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faster growth in the core is multiplied into a more service-rich support environment, thus making it more attractive for future economic activity. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spread Effects- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forces of deconcentration. Eventually, growth in the core stimulates demand for goods and services from the periphery, and regional subcenters emerge to lead the peripheral areas. High density, congestion, high labor costs, and environmental decay in the core and the diffusion of technology to the periphery also encourage the outward dispersion of growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The dependency school of though incokes the existence of core periphery relationships at the global scale to expalin the persistent lack of development in the periphery; most LDCs were colonized during the 19th century to supply cheap raw materials and crops to European factories in the core; they also served as peripheral markets; education lagged, little industrial base was developed, and export oriented transport systems were constructed with the sole purpose of funneling the products of forests, farms, and mines to coastal ports for shipment to the mother country; taxes were frequently imposed to force subsistence farmers to produce crops that could be sold for cash, which could then be used to pay the colonial tax; when most former colonies became independent, their economies depended heavily on the former colonial rulers to purchase the raw materials they produced, they lacked economic and political leadership, and their transport networks were woefully inadequate for independent economic development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Neocolonialism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set into motion by LDCs initial dependence on colonial mother countries; A type of economic development that continues to render LDCs countries economically dependent to their mother countries. Production and trade are now controlled by multinational corporations rather than by colonial governments, but former colonies remain locked into an over dependence on exporting unprocessed raw materials at cheap prices to rich countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Import Substitution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a popular development policy during the 1970s made to rectify the dependency in neocolonialism. Countries were encouraged to produce internally what they had previously relied on from the mother country, especially basic, low-tech consumer goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><strong> Protectionism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a policy that imposes high import tariffs on foreign goods to protect infant &nbsp;home grown industries</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- </span><strong>Nationalization of foreign owned asset</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">s- another widespread practice in the postcolonial periiod- example- the Mexican oil industry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Apart from the purely economic development strategies of the dependency school, a central concern was also to imporve human welfare by providing the basic physical and social needs of citizens; the goal was to improve the overall quality of life for the masses; Unlike the top down, structural change model of the postwar era, the approach to development of the 1970s argued for a bottom uup strategy; more resources were directed toward traditionally poor sectors of society, such as day laborers and agricultural peasants , to meet their education, health, food, water, and shelter needs; emphasis on human welfare concerns represented a deliberate effort to redistribute capital more evenly, in order to generate a strong middle class that would have the buying power to purchase the nationally produced goods that import substitution encouraged; many governments in the developing world, dissatisfied with persistent poverty, took an active role in trying to raise standards of living</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Human Welfare Indicators- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development indicators based on a country&rsquo;s success in meeting the basic needs of its citizens; direcly affected by the choice to focus on human welfare needs rather than strictly economic development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Neoliberal Counterrevolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dovetailed with the free-market approaches of the 1980s and the end of the Cold War. US Ronald Reagan and UK Margaret Thatcher. They argued that protectionism and state-owned industries perpetuated dependency rather than cured it. Protected state-owned industries were not forced by the market to be competitive in price and quality. International agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund imposed economic reforms such as free trade and selling off of government owned industries to the private sector as conditions for getting economic assistance. Instead of protectionism to keep out foreign competition, the neoliberal approach advocates that countries allow their own currencies to devalue relative to other currencies in order to make their exports more attractive; developing countries competed to attract foreign direct investment. Neoliberal reforms are also social phenomena- social welfare programs from healthcare to education have been opened up to market competition by cost cutting governments</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Transition Economies- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countries converting from socialist to capitalist economies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Sustainable Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">1990s. Progress should not come at the expense of future generations by warming the climate, reducing biodiversity, depleting forests, increasing pollution, and reducing the resource base. Most LDCs would like to protect their environments but not at the cost of reducing their standard of living; Sustainability proponents argue that development and environmental protection are not conflicting goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Efficient energy and water use, renewable resources, pollution reduction, and protection of forests and wetlands make long term economic sense; the sustainable development movement aims to help the LDCs skip the inefficient dependency on fossil fuels that the MDC experienced and vault right to efficient renewable technologies; popular sustainable policies: ecotourism, partnerships with developed countries to introduce clean technologies, and western pharmaceutical companies paying royalties on drugs developed from rainforest species</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Appropriate Technology- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coincident with sustainable development, has regained favor;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of the large-scale technology suited to the capital-rich, labor-scarce industrial world, what are needed are technologies appropriate to the capital-poor, labor-abundant, predominantly agricultural developing world-production by the masses rather than mass production. Debated and practiced since the 1970s, with E. F. Schumacher, the economist who coined the phrase; Appropriate technology goes hand in hand with the renewed emphasis that sustainable development places on ecologically and culturally sensitive development strategies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Appropriate technology is not a return to the primitive technology of the past but involves tools that are inexpensive and simple enough to be widely adopted and maintained by peasants, do not degrade the environment or human dignity, and are in keeping with the local culture</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><strong>Machismo- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Male emphasis on masculine traits. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-8">Chapter 8: Food For Thought</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 8 &ldquo;Food for Thought&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; The types of agricultural practices and agricultural systems worldwide are discussed. The agricultural revolutions and GMO&rsquo;s as well as the globalization of agriculture. Plantations, agribusiness, and shifting cultivation are some of the topics covered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chapter looks at agriculture and the traditional geographic idea of how and what people farm in different places. It also looks at the contemporary idea of globalization. These old and new ideas will come together to explain how the forces of globalization are changing local agricultural systems in Latin America. </span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A country&rsquo;s agriculture remains one of the best measures of the level of development and standard of living. Even though have been big changes, agriculture in developing countries still employs most of the population, and producing food for the local market is the main goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Globalization- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing tendency for distant places and people to link together in a global market by fast, cheap transportation and communication. &nbsp;The increasing economic, cultural, demographic, political, and environmental interdependence of different places around the world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Three Reasons To Know About Agriculture- </strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the land surface of the planet is devoted to agriculture. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half of all families in less-developed countries (LDCs) earn their living by farming. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture is a major contributor to environmental change in the form of pesticide and fertilizer runoff, soil erosion, freshwater depletion, damming of rivers for irrigation purposes, and deforestation.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Agriculture-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The intentional planting of crops and raising of domesticated animals.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Not synonymous with food production, since some crops and livestock are raised for nonfood purposes. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Livestock- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domesticated animals such as cow, sheep, and poultry that are raised and managed to produce meat, milk, eggs, wool, leather, etc. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Hunting And Gathering- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collecting of roots, seeds, fruit, and fiber from wild plants and the hunting and fishing of wild animals. Usually brings to mind a primitive, pre agricultural society that is rapidly disappearing from the earth; but if you think about it, most fishing and forestry rare in fact modern-day forms of hunting wild fish and gathering wild trees. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Mixed Farming- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An integrated agricultural system in which crops are grown and fed to livestock. </span></p>
<p><strong>-First Agricultural Revolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original invention of farming and domestication of livestock 8000-1400 years ago and the subsequent dispersal of these methods from the source regions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Second Agricultural Revolution- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A period of technological change from the 1600s to mid-1900s that started in Western Europe, beginning with pre industrial improvements such as crop rotation and better horse collars, and concluding with industrial innovations to replace human labor with machines and to supplement natural fertilizers and pesticides with chemical ones. Intensified agriculture in the sense of promoting higher yields per acre and per farmer. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Third Agricultural Revolution (Green Revolution)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Began in the 1960s and continues to this day. Introduced and diffused hybrid strains of staple grains by cross-pollinating different native strains of grain. The application of biological science to the development of better strains of plants and animals for increasing agricultural yields. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Yield- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Output per unit land per unit time (e.g. tons per acre per year). </span></p>
<p><strong>-Capital- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods that are used in the production of other goods, such as machinery, tools, facilities, vehicles, and transport networks. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Labor-Intensive Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows a single farmer to produce as much as 100 labor-intensive farmers can by substituting capital for labor. Agriculture in which a large amount of human work is applied per unit of output. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Capital-Intensive Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows a single farmer to produce as much as 100 labor-intensive farmers can by substituting capital for labor. Agriculture in which a large amount of capital is applied per unit of output. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Intensive Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yields a large amount of output per acre through concentrated application of labor and/or capital, usually to small landholdings. Small area farms and ranches with high inputs of labor per acre and high output per acre. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Extensive Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yields a much smaller output per acre as farmers or ranchers spread their labor and capital over large areas of land. Large area farms or ranches with low inputs of labor per acre and low output per acre. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Subsistence Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-sufficient agriculture, usually small scale and low tech, primarily for direct consumption by the local population. Farmers and ranchers produce animals or crops to feed their families. Families and villages are nearly self-sufficient and do not depend on trade with other regions. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Commercial Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers and ranchers sell all of their output for money, and buy their families&rsquo; food at stores. Agriculture primarily for the purpose of selling the products for money. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Sedentary Agriculture - </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refers to farmers and ranchers who live and work in a single location. Agriculture that takes place in the immediate surroundings of a permanent settlement. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Nomadic Agriculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to sedentary, refers to production that shifts from place to place.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Nomadism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migratory movement of herders and their animals according to the availability of grazing land. Not random wandering but a systematic movement pattern among proven locations. Can be horizontal, from one water source to another, or vertical, from lowlands in the winter to highlands in the summer (also known as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">transhumance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><strong>-Shifting Cultivation (Slash-And-Burn Agriculture)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A farming method in tropical areas in which wild vegetation is cleared and burned before crops are planted. When the soil fertility is diminished, farmers abandon the land to restore itself naturally, and they move to new areas where they repeat the process. Farmers work the land for several years before moving on to another area. This form of farming is also known as slash-and-burn because the farmers cut the undergrowth and smaller trees and burn them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Irrigated Land (vs. Non-Irrigated Lands)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply refers to artificial watering of farmland. Necessary in arid lands and areas with uncertain or seasonal precipitation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Sharecropping- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variation on tenant farming, by which farmers pay rent in the form of a percentage of the crop, which allows the farmer to share the risk with landowners. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Plantations- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in LDCs. Are mainly historical leftovers from colonialism. A large estate that produces a single cash crop, mainly found now in the tropics. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Land Reform- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A general term encompassing policies designed to give more of the population access to land that they can manage and steward themselves. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Agribusiness- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An industrialized, corporate form of agriculture organized into integrated networks of agricultural inputs and outputs controlled by a small number of large corporations. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Time-Space Convergence- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate at which the time separating two places decreases because of improvements in transportation or communication technology. Rapid transport and instantaneous communications technologies shrink space and stretch time. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Friction of Distance- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A measure of how much distance discourages movement between places, based on the time, energy, or dollar cost that must have expanded. Is continually being reduced, bringing distance places closer together. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Free Trade- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imports and exports between countries that are unrestricted by tariffs, quotas, or excessive approvals and paperwork. Markets must be accessible to the supplier that can produce the best product for the lowest price. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Comparative Advantage- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When one region is relatively more efficient at producing a particular product compared with other regions. Depends on the relative efficiency with which a region can produce a product compared with other products and other regions. Can lead to beneficial trade even when one region can produce all products and other regions. Can lead to beneficial trade even when one region can produce all products for a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Monoculture- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Production of one crop year after year with factories located nearby to process and package the product for export. Increases a region&rsquo;s vulnerability to the vicissitudes of bad weather, pests, and global price swings. Agriculture that uses a large area of land for production of a single crop year after year. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Global-Local Continuum- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interaction between global processes and local lifestyles. This continuum is a two-way process in which the local and the global shape each other. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Remote Sensing-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A process by which we acquire images of earth from orbiting satellites. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Land Use- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general class of activity for which land is used by humans in a particular area.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Land Cover- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general class of material or vegetation that dominates the surface of the land in a particular area. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-9">Chapter 9: Take Me Out To The Ballgame</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Kuby Chapter 9 &ndash; Take Me Out to the Ballgame. &ldquo;We learn about central place functions and urban hierarchy as we study central place theory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we will continue to learn about the functions of cities as we study central place functions and learn how cities are ordered in a country. &nbsp;We will spend a few more weeks on the study of cities as they are critical to understand in human geography. </span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>-Central Place- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">People travel to this place in order to make purchases, generally. A city or town that provides goods and services to the surrounding population. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Market Areas- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas from which people travel to make purchases in central places, generally. One example of the functional regions discussed in Chapter 2. The area in which residents favor a given central place over its competitors when shopping for a good or service. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Central Place Function- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good or service that is provided by the central place for its trade area. These functions have an </span><strong>order </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or relative ranking based on how specialized they are, how large a market area is needed to keep them in business, and how far people are willing to travel to obtain them. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Threshold </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a good</span><strong>- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minimum market area size needed to support a central place function (a good). A limit from the business&rsquo;s point of view. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Range </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a good</span><strong>- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maximum distance a customer is willing to travel to obtain a central place function. The limit from the consumer&rsquo;s point of view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Low order central place function-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> obtained on a regular basis; requires only a small market area to be profitable (small threshold), and people are unwilling to travel far to obtain it (small range); Examples: grocery stores, family doctors, dentists, gas stations, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Medium order functions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- lawyers, movie theaters, shoe stores, etc; these require market areas of an in between size</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>High order central place functions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- hospitals, neurosurgeon, oriental antique shop, professional basketball stadiums, zoological gardens, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Urban Hierarchy- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides central place functions. Cities are organized into a hierarchy according to their size and importance. Importance in this context stems from whether they offer low- or high-order &nbsp;central place functions. Cities at the bottom of the urban hierarchy offer only low-order functions. Low-order cities are small, many in number, and relatively close together. Mid-sized cities offer low-order goods and services for their residents as well as medium-order functions for themselves and for those living in smaller cities within their sphere of influence. Mid-sized cities are fewer in number and farther apart than the lower-order centers. At the top of the hierarchy are the highest-order centers that offer all lower order goods and services, higher order goods and services, and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><strong>Central Place Theory:</strong> <a href="http://lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki2011/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=102"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki2011/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=102</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A central place is a market center for the exchange of goods and services by people attracted from the surrounding area. The central place is so called because it is centrally located to maximize accessibility from the surrounding region. Central places compete against each other to serve as markets for goods and services, according to central place theory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The geographic concept of central place theory explains how services are distributed and why a regular pattern of settlements exists, at least in a MDC such as the United States. Central Place Theory was first proposed in the 1930s by German geographer Walter Christaller, based on his studies of southern Germany. August Losch in Germany and Brian Berry and others in the U.S further developed concepts during the 1950s. The theory applies most clearly in regions such as the Great Plains, which are neither heavily industrialized nor interrupted by major physical features such as rivers or mountain ranges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In regards to human geography, central place theory is another way to help predict how cities grow and develop. Nodal regions such as market areas and locations of resources and certain activities are also pointed out by central place theory. Central place theory helps in answering why certain consumer services are distributed in a regular pattern, as observed in actual cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christaller postulated:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;Cites would be regularly spaced w/central places where the same product was sold at the same price was a standard distance apart</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;Each city has a complementary region in which they have a monopoly on the sale of certain goods</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A system of cities consisting of various levels, with few cities at the top level and more and more settlements on each lower level. The position of a city within the hierarchy is determined by the types of central place functions it provides. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Central Place Theory- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizes the elements of the urban hierarchy into a unified spatial network of cities and towns. Developed initially by German economic geographer Walter Christaller in 1933 and refined by another German, august Losch, in 1956, central place theory begins with some simplifying assumptions about the landscape. It assumes that the system of central places evolves on a flat, featureless, infinite plain of uniform population density and that customers prefer to shop at the nearest location that offers the product or service they need. To minimize travel distances for customers on a uniform landscape, the ideal shape for market areas would be a circle. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This theory assumes that businesses would spread out to cover an entire region with circular market areas, and that competition and entry of new firms would lead to market areas being packed together as tightly as possible, with each market area driven toward the minimum threshold size for that type of activity. Circles, however, cannot pack together perfectly without either leaving unserved spaces between the circles or overlapping each other. Each assumption leads to a network of hexagonal market areas for each type of good or service. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central place theory takes these principles one step further and layers the networks of hexagonal market areas of different sizes on top of each other, like honey combs of small, medium, and large bees. Christaller offered a simple and sensible principle addressing how the different layers of hexagons related to one another. His theory assumes that higher-order central places offer not only the goods and services of that level of the hierarchy but also all lower-order goods and services. Central place theory assumes that the system of central places evolves on a featureless, infinite landscape of uniform population density. The real world of course is not so neat and tidy, and therefore cities and towns are not so perfectly spaced. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do the different layers of hexagons (market areas) relate to each other: Christaller offers a simple and sensible principle: His central place theory assumes that higher order central places offer not only the goods and services of that level of the hierarchy but also all lower order goods and services; (E.G.- A place with a concert hall and airport will also have a movie theater and bus station/A place with a movie theater and bus station will also have a video store and gas station); Thus, the largest places have a large market area for their higher order goods and services, a medium market area for their medium order functions, and a small market area for their low order businesses; likewise, the mid sized towns have both medium market areas for their mid level functions, and a small market area for their low order goods; the low order places, however, have only small market areas; the market area layers therefore nest together in a hierarchy across spatial scales that create the mature urban system</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central place theory assumes that the system of central place evolves on a featureless, infinite landscape of uniform population density; the real world is not so neat and tidy, and therefore cities and towns are not so perfectly spaced; Many factors distort the ideal pattern, including rivers, mountains, coastlines, political boundaries, railroads, highways, and canals, as well as differences in population density, wealth, and cultural tastes; The idea is not to become obsessed with the exact size and shape of market areas but instead to focus on the spatial regularities of the size, frequency, and general spacing of places supplying low order versus high order central place functions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theoretically, a circle is the ideal market area shape because it contains all space closest to a central place. However, with neighboring central places in the urban hierarchy circles would either overlap (which indicates that some areas would not be served by a central place). Central place theory, however, assumes that all areas must be served and that people shop at their nearest central place offering a good or service. This can be accomplished by non overlapping, space filling hexagonal market areas, which can be derived from the network of circular market areas by assigning each point within the overlapping or unserved areas to its closest central place. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A geographic model of the sizes and location patterns of settlements that serve as central locations for selling goods and services to hexagonal-shaped market areas. </span></p>

<p><strong>Definition of Key Terms:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Central Place</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a city or town that provides goods and services to the surrounding population</span></p>
<p><strong>Central Place Function</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a good or service that a central place provides</span></p>
<p><strong>Central Place Theory</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a geographic model of the sizes and location patterns of settlements that serve as central locations for selling goods and services to hexagonal shaped market areas</span></p>
<p><strong>Market Area</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the area in which residents favor a given central place over its competitors when shopping for a good or service</span></p>
<p><strong>Order-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the relative ranking of a central place function based on how specialized it is</span></p>
<p><strong>Range</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the maximum distance people are willing to travel to obtain a central place function</span></p>
<p><strong>Threshold</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the minimum market size needed to support a central place function</span></p>
<p><strong>Urban hierarchy</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a system of cities consisting of various levels, with few cities at the top level and more and more settlements on each lower level; the position of a city within the hierarchy is determined by the types of central place functions it provides</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-10">Chapter 10: Reading The Urban Landscape</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 10 &ldquo;Reading the Urban Landscape: Census Data and Field Observation&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; We will study the concentric ring model, the sector model, and the multiple nuclei model as we learn about the many changes that have occurred in the American city.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Three early models that attempted to capture land use patterns of the city:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Concentric ring/zone model</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: model of city development and land use; developed in the 1920&rsquo;s &nbsp;by Robert Paul and Ernest Burgess of the so called Chicago School of urban sociology; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burgess was the first sociologist to pose a theory about why certain social groups are located in specific urban areas. His model was based on the city of </span><strong>Chicago</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and used a concentric ring to show how urban land was used </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- said that the city was organized in a series of concentric rings; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><strong>model</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is based on the idea that land values are highest in the centre of a town or city. This is because competition is high in the central parts of the settlement</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Central Business district </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CBD)- downtown- high rise, high rent; packed with corporate offices, consumer services, shopping, and government buildings, was the focus of the city&rsquo;s commercial, social, and civic life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In the early twentieth century, urban employment was concentrated in and around the CBD; it was immediately surrounded by a </span><strong>fringe zone</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of land uses for which centrality is important for survival; the fringe included wholesaling, warehousing, light industry, and bus and train terminals, and is also marked by older, rundown housing and the encroachment of business from the CBD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Housing in this zone ran the gamut from crowded tenements to once grand homes that wealthy occupants abandoned when they moved outward, and was home to the city&rsquo;s newest, poorest residents, often immigrants or ethnic minorities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The </span><strong>other zones</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consisted of increasingly well off residents, starting with the homes of blue collar workers who typically worked in the city&rsquo;s manufacturing plants adjacent to the downtown, then medium income single family houses, and finally the residences of high income commuter</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The basic idea of this model was that the residential geography of the city was driven by a process of </span><strong>invasion and succession </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">whereby new immigrants to the city moved into the oldest housing near the city center and pushed earlier groups outward; each succeeding wave of immigration and the expansion of the downtown and its fringe produced a chain reaction, with each preceding group moving outward</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- This model of urban structure and growth was a good fit for the large cities of North America during the early twentieth century when immigration was high,, few families owned private automobiles, and nearly all factory, department store, and office jobs were either in the downtown or its fringe</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Park and Burgess before him, land economist Homer Hoyt studied Chicago, which was rapidly expanding into its surrounding flat, featureless farmland as his initial laboratory; Hoyt, however, came up with a markedly different urban structure and causal process</span></p>
<p><strong>- Sector model</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also known as the Hoyt model, this is a model of urban land use proposed in 1932 by economist Homer Hoyt. It is a modification of the concentric zone model of city development. The benefits of the application of this model include the fact it allows for an outward progression of growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Published/proposed in 1939, this model of urban land use rejected the concentric zone theory, arguing instead that housing values in US cities conformed to a pattern of sectors radiating out from the downtown rather than of concentric zones</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- There was still a progression from low to high social class, with the middle class serving as a buffer between them, but these districts were arranged in </span><strong>wedges radiating outward</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the city center rather than rings around the city center; </span><strong>High rent areas</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> radiated outward along fashionable boulevards and environmentally desirable corridors such as high ground, ocean fronts, lakeshores, bays, and parks; Whatever direction from the city center was considered desirable tended to remain desirable as the city expanded, and the wealthy continued to commute along their established lines of travel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The wealthy also tried to locate as far away as possible from the </span><strong>low income zones</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which tended to be either in more central locations or adjacent to industrial areas along railroad tracks where many </span><strong>blue collar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> workers were employed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Middle income areas</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tended to locate on either side of the high rent corridors</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Multiple Nuclei Model-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> third model of urban land use which viewed the city as being composed of groupings of specialized land uses such as retail districts, port districts, manufacturing districts, and high income housing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- First proposed in 1945 by University of Chicago geographers Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman, when the growing popularity of the automobile was just beginning to create commercial office, and industrial employment clusters outside the CBD for the growing suburban population</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The multiple nuclei model was visionary in anticipating the postwar development of suburban shopping and office centers; it is a more flexible model than the other two models in the sense that the districts in the model are not always of the same shapes or the same spatial arrangement; Generally, the idea behind this model is that </span><strong>not all employment is located in the CBD,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that certain activities tend to be found in adjacent districts of the city, such as</span><strong> middle class neighborhoods</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bordering exclusive neighborhoods and </span><strong>lower class neighborhoods</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bordering manufacturing and wholesaling</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- As the automobile became more prevalent and large suburban cities grew, the multiple nuclei model morphed into the concept of urban realms</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Urban realms-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relatively independent suburban regions functionally tied to a mixed use &ldquo;suburban downtown&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The concept of urban realms recognizes that the daily activities of many people occur within a limited subsection of the metropolitan region, so that suburban dwellers interact on a regular basis with their nearby suburban downtown and its immediate vicinity and rarely travel to the CBD and other suburban realms;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- While these early land use models were helpful in describing the spatial organization of early twentieth century industrial cities, they are less useful today in describing the structure of urban space, since urban geography today is greatly influenced by the concept of postmodernism</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Postmodernism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- influences urban geography today, both as a theoretical viewpoint and as a style of architecture and urban design</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Postmodernism flatly rejects the worldview that there are universal models for how the world does or should function; Postmodernism celebrates diversity and denies that any perspective, style, or subgroup has a monopoly on truth or beauty</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Postmodern architecture emphasizes style, aesthetics, decoration, context, and historic preservation- form as well as function</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Postmodernism is important for understanding the urban landscape because today&rsquo;s cities, while still &nbsp;bearing the imprint of modernity, have become more diverse collections of spaces and nodes designed for highly segmented markets of consumers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Demographic trends have increased cultural diversity and led to social fragmentation along age, race, ethnic, income, class, and lifestyle lines in North American cities; instead of just assimilating into the US melting pot, ethnic groups today celebrate their cultural heritage</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Because of this, the chicago school&rsquo;s stereotypical nuclear family notion of suburban areas dominated by young families with children, large families, low female labor force participation, and single family housing is far too simplistic to capture the demographics of today&rsquo;s suburbs, and is a clear minority of all living arrangements</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Similarly, the idea of inner city areas as dominated by childless couples and singles is often not matched by today&rsquo;s diverse inner city populations</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Modernism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- based on a belief in the preeminence of scientific rationality and the inevitability of human progress; emphasizes function over form and universal models of how things are or should be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- This encompassed much of early to mid twentieth century thinking (and doing) in many spheres of life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In architecture and urban design, modernism meant functional, boxy skyscrapers in the CBD, multi story apartment towers in the inner city, and mile after mile of ranch houses in the suburbs; the stereotypical modern North American family was thought to contain a male breadwinner, his non working wife, and minor children</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In urban geography, the concentric ring and sector models represented modernistic thinking about urban form</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In nearly all North American cities, the relentless march of middle and upper class people and jobs to the suburbs, planned communities, and more recently to revitalized downtowns has left poor and disadvantaged populations in slums</span></p>
<p><strong>- Slum-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> run down, inner city neighborhood; these are home to many abandoned buildings and an urban underclass with three defining characteristics</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Urban underclass</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Three defining characteristics: 1) Persistently poor 2) Plagued by a variety of social ills, including out of wedlock births, high dropout rates, crime, gangs, and drugs 3) Lives in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty where most of their neighbors are also persistently poor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The spatial concentration of the underclass means they are physically distanced from the urban area&rsquo;s new job opportunities in the suburbs and socially isolated from middle class lifestyles; as many urban cities point out, the spatial concentration of the underclass is partly a result of racial and ethnic discrimination, which has played a role in denying equal opportunity to bank loans, apartment rentals, jobs, and education that would enable aspiring individuals to improve, or move out of, their neighborhoods</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Gentrification</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- involved the physical revitalization of some older, architecturally and historically significant neighborhoods; Initially, gentrifiers tended to be nontraditional households- gay partners, childless couples, and singles- seeking open neighborhoods where they would fit in and their lifestyles would be accepted; Later, gentrified neighborhoods attracted a diverse mix of the young and old, straight and gay, married and singles, and parents and childless</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Gentrified neighborhoods offer proximity to work, access to cultural and entertainment activities that have sprouted in many downtown districts, and the opportunity to live in an authentic, unique, and stimulating place that is connected with the city&rsquo;s history- a far cry from placeless suburban tract housing and strip malls that dominated new construction of the era</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Although gentrification has had a valuable and highly visible effect on some urban neighborhoods, it often drives out the neighborhood&rsquo;s previous population that can no longer afford high rents and real estate taxes</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The postmodern hunger for neighborhoods that provide meaning, identity, diversity, and excitement in people's lives in likened to what public policy professor RIchard Florida calls the rise of the </span><strong>creative class</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Creative clas</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">s- As the economy changed from activities that emphasized raw materials and brute physical labor to activities based on human intelligence, knowledge, and creativity, economic growth became more closely tied to new ideas and new ways of doing things rather than to producing things; the creative class consists of scientists, engineers, artists, musicians, designers, and knowledge based professionals who are engaged in the arts, knowledge production, and innovation, and in finding creative solutions to old and new problems</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The urban regions and neighborhoods that offer these crucial place based attributes have, according to Richard Florida, a distinct advantage in the global competition for new ideas and new ways of doing things- the basis for twenty first century economic growth </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- In this urban environment of rapid economic and social change, downtown districts have had to reinvent themselves to survive; downtowns of the twenty first century are nerve centers for the new postindustrial, global information economy, and once again they are attracting new corporate headquarters</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The postmodern urban landscape belies the modernist notion that it is beneficial to segregate residential, commercial, office, recreational, and industrial land uses from one another</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Despite the immense success of downtown redevelopment events and gentrification efforts, suburbanization has continued apace</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Suburbanization</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the decentralization of the urban economy and population</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Urban decentralization has given rise to edge cities, a term coined by journalist Joel Garreau</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Edge cities</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a new form of high density, mixed use development in the suburbs; Edge cities emerge from the suburban downtowns of the urban realm concept, but they are far more than just shopping malls- they are spread out suburban downtowns with tall buildings, office space for white collar jobs, shopping centers, entertainment complexes, hotels, corporate headquarters, and hospitals- pinnacles of a consumer/service oriented society</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Edge cities contain many of the urban functions typically found in the old downtown, but they are built to be served by automobile rather than pedestrian travel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Circumferential beltways further reduce the dependence of these suburban areas on the CBD; high tech corridors with meticulously landscaped offices, research and development laboratories, clean industries, and hotels are a postmodern feature of the edge city landscape</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Even before the 2008 recession, both traditional suburbs and inner cities were losing population to far flung exurbs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Exurbs</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- settlements more isolated and rural in character than typical suburbs and far beyond the metropolitan edge; these discrete subdivisions or converted farmhouses are often populated by wealthy homeowners who rely on long distance connections to the city, but may not commute to a job on a rigid daily schedule; they provide access to the services and office headquarters of the metro area, while also maintaining a rural feel in desirable places far from the congestion of city life</span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-11">Chapter 11: The Disappearing Front Range</h2>

<p><strong>Urban Sprawl- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spread of dispersed urban land uses outside compact urban centers into previously rural areas. term we use for low-density development at, and sometimes beyond, the outer margins of our metropolitan areas. Sprawl is now the prevailing form of urban growth in North American cities. It gobbles up acre upon acre of valuable farmland and open space, exacerbates problems of traffic congestion, traps the population under a hood of smog, and adds to the expense of providing urban services. It is possible to plan urban growth that exhibits little of what we think of as &ldquo;sprawl,&rdquo; but there are numerous influences that drive low-density growth on the </span><strong>urban fringe- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the edge of the urbanized or built-up area. </span></p>
<p><strong>Urbanized (Or Built-Up) Area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In each era of urban expansion, the spatial extent of the urbanized (or built-up) area was constrained by the prevailing transportation networks. </span></p>
<p><strong>Urban Realms- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Were first supplanted by the expression &ldquo;bedroom suburbs,&rdquo; popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Relatively independent suburban regions. Suburban region functionally tied to a mixed-use &ldquo;suburban downtown&rdquo; with relative independence from the CBD. </span></p>
<p><strong>Edge Cities/Satellite Towns- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suburban nodes of employment and economic activity featuring high-rise office space, corporate headquarters, shopping, entertainment, and hotels. Their physical layout is designed for automobile, not pedestrian, travel. See Chapter 10 Notes. </span></p>
<p><strong>Mass Transit-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Works best in bringing people along densely populated corridors to the CBD. Public transportation models such as buses, subways, jitneys and vanpools, light rail (trolleys, streetcars), heavy rail (passenger trains), and monorails. </span></p>
<p><strong>Leapfrog Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occurs, around some urban areas, well beyond the limits of the current </span><strong>urbanized area- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the continuously built-up region of a metropolitan area. Development that jumps over available land on the urban fringe, taking advantage of the most distant and least-developed land within the city limits to plan an entire new community, separated from the urban fringe by rural land. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10 Traits Associated With Sprawl (identified by well-known policy analyst Anthony Downs)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlimited outward extension</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-density development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leapfrog development miles beyond the urban fringe</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fragmentation of political powers among many small municipalities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominance of transportation by private automobiles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of centralized planning or control of land uses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial strip development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great fiscal disparities among towns and neighborhoods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segregation of types of land uses in different zones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliance on a trickle-down process to provide low-income housing </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Metropolitan Government (trait #6)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A regional governmental agency created to coordinate a variety of areawide functions such as water supply, transportation, open space, and waste management on behalf of the independent cities within the region. It is a response to the political fragmentation of the urban area. </span></p>
<p><strong>Zoning- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">City planners traditionally use zoning to separate incompatible land uses, such as housing and chemical factories. Planning regulations that define permissible land uses for parcels of the city. </span></p>
<p><strong>Congestion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of roads, causing travel delays. </span></p>
<p><strong>Visual Preference Surveys- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shown photographs of urban scenery, most people prefer images of neighborhoods and shopping centers that do not reflect the designs typically built in sprawling cities. </span></p>
<p><strong>New Urbanism- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular alternative to a solution: a movement by architects and planners to build more traditional neighborhoods that foster a sense of community. New Urbanism emphasizes people, not cars. </span></p>
<p><strong>Mixed-Use Developments (MUD)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new kind of zoning classification, stresses location of residential and commercial uses in close proximity and at a greater density so that people can walk to work, stores, and schools. House types are also mixed to promote diversity. All of these alternative are seen as ways to promote neighborhood interaction instead of the sense of isolation that is characteristic of much of suburbia. </span></p>
<p><strong>Form-Based Codes- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third and more recently proposed solution to sprawl. These are zoning regulations that focus on the form of development first and foremost-building placement, building type, lot configuration, and other elements of physical form. The intent is to balance predictability and flexibility-to regulate so that the community knows what it&rsquo;s getting without constraining design too tightly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>Infill Development- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher-density development in smaller patches of undeveloped or redevelopable land inside the urban boundaries. </span></p>
<p><strong>Growth Boundaries- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instituted by Portland in 1980. Put fixed limits on urban expansion. A planning boundary beyond which conversion of rural land uses to urban land uses is strictly prohibited. </span></p>
<p><strong>Light-Rail- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public transportation using rail at street level. Usually has a separate right-of-way on one side of a street or in a median. Unlike some streetcars and trolleys, light rail stops only at permanent stations. Operates at slower speeds, with lower capacities and costs, than subway, commuter rail, or elevated rail. </span></p>
<p><strong>Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dense nodes of housing, shops, restaurants, and offices accessible to light-rail or subway shops. </span></p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An individual or group with a strong interest or stake in how an issue is decided. Antisprawl policies must satisfy them to be successful. </span></p>
<p><strong>Scenarios- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sense of assumptions about the future that defines the basis for planning and modeling. </span></p>
<p><strong>Ecologically Sensitive Space- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fragile, rare, or valuable natural areas that are good candidates for preservation as parks, wilderness, or open space. </span></p>
<p><strong>Trade-Offs- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One urban model will never fit all Americans. Geographers and planners refer to these types of situations as trade-offs, in which one objective must be sacrificed to achieve progress on another. A decision situation in which it is not possible to advance two conflicting goals simultaneously; that is, it is necessary to give up something in order to get something else. Compare with win-win situation. </span></p>
<p><strong>Win-Win Situations- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solution in which it is possible to advance two goals simultaneously. Compare with trade-off. </span></p>
<p><strong>Urban Village- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A concentration of commercial land uses and higher-density housing outside the region&rsquo;s main central business district that is planned to be a focal point of shopping and employment for surrounding residential areas. Can be the anchor point of an urban realm.The concept is loosely based on the principles of New Urbanism so that mixed-use development of homes, shops, entertainment, and work are nearby. </span></p>
<p><strong>Infill- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fills in most existing developable space in the city before new growth occurs on the periphery. The result would be a denser inner city that minimizes the spatial extent of developed land into the rural plains. </span></p>
<p><strong>Growth Boundary- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One type of policy that can be used to achieve the infill strategy: literally, a line drawn on the map outside of which conversion of rural to urban land is prohibited. If such a line were drawn without including much available land, housing values would rapidly increase inside the boundary. </span></p>

<h2 id = "chapter-12">Chapter 12: Do Orange And Green Clash?</h2>
<div class = "dr-g-notes">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we are continuing our study of urban matters. &nbsp;Our Kuby Activity teaches us more about residential segregation and how it looks in different places. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Chapter 12 &ldquo;Do Orange and Green Clash?&rdquo; in Kuby &ldquo;Human Geography in Action workbook.&rdquo; Residential segregation, ghettos, ethnic cleansing, and integration are discussed. Apartheid and segregation indices are covered.</span></p>
</div>

<p><strong>- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">People of the same social class, occupation, race, ethnicity, and religion often cluster together in a process called residential segregation</span></p>
<p><strong>-Residential Segregation-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The residential separation of subgroups within the larger population. Can result from both voluntary and involuntary forces, although the two are sometimes difficult to separate.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Ghettos- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products of involuntary segregation. The term ghetto comes from the Italian word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">ghetto, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning foundry, because the first ghetto in Venice, in 1516, was on the site of an iron foundry. Example: Jewish ghettos.</span></p>
<p><strong>-Enclaves- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residential clusters that occur when people choose to live together- voluntary segregation -for example, to maintain their ethnic identity or to establish control over their territory. Immigrant enclaves (Hispanic barrios, Little Saigon of Los Angeles, Little Havana in Miami) provide much-needed social support for new immigrants and are seedbeds for new immigrant businesses. They offer a wide array of restaurants, food markets, foreign-language newspapers, temples and churches, social clubs, and traditional medicine to those who live and work there. Enclaves also give social groups a measure of political influence that would not be possible if the group were spread out (growing influence of Cuban Americans in south Florida). </span></p>
<p><strong>-Social Distance- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measures the likelihood that dissimilar groups will interact with one another or, in the case of racial and ethnic segregation, whether the minority group will be accepted and assimilated into the majority populationi; influences the degree of assimilation for minority groups. The greater the degree of segregation of a particular group from the larger population, the greater the social distance between them. Social distance measures the likelihood that dissimilar groups will interact with one another or, in the case of racial and ethnic segregation, whether the minority group will be accepted and assimilated into the majority population. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Segregation Indices- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A numerical measure of the degree of separation of two or more distinct groups. Measures various dimensions of residential segregation, including evenness, concentration, and centralization. One such index, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">index of dissimilarity, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">considers how the geographic distribution of a group compares to the distribution of a second reference group. This segregation index has values that range from 0 in cases of complete integration to 1.0 in cases of complete segregation. A value of 0.5 indicates that 50 percent of the particular group being studied would need to change their residences for the group to be distributed like the other group</span></p>
<p><strong>-Ethnic Cleansing-</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Efforts by an ethnic group to &ldquo;purify&rdquo; their territory by forcing members of other ethnic groups out through terrorism, violence, or forcible removal. A euphemism for genocide, house burnings, and forced migration for the purpose of achieving 100 percent residential segregation along ethnic lines. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Integration- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes groups do the opposite of ethnic cleansing as a political weapon. The residential mixing of subgroups within the larger population. In Israel, right wing Jews have ought to build settlements in the Palestinian dominated West Bank region to prevent Israeli leaders from giving the land to an independent Palestinian state; In this case, the segregation/integration varies by scale</span></p>
<p><strong>-Apartheid- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until 1993, the white regime in South Africa practiced enforced segregation through a system of apartheid; A system of forced segregation between races in South Africa in effect until 1993. Means &ldquo;separateness&rdquo; in Afrikaans. Under apartheid, whites, &ldquo;coloureds&rdquo; (persons of mixed races), and Indians were restricted to certain urban neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Plantation System- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An organized system of colonization. The British used a plantation system to alter the ethnic composition of entire regions. These are not plantations in the sense of a commercial farm like a coffee plantation, but deliberate, government-sponsored campaigns to &ldquo;plant&rdquo; pioneers loyal to the British Crown. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Tenant Farmers- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A farmer who rents land to larm. Although tenant farmers often live in debt to the landowner, they are considered more fortunate than landless laborers, who neither own nor rent their own land. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spatial Divergence- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occurs if the two groups become spatially more segregated. </span></p>
<p><strong>-Spatial Convergence- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occurs if the two groups become spatially more integrated. </span></p>
